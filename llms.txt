# llms.txt
# Purpose:
# - A plain-text file placed in the `public` folder so it is published at the
#   site root (e.g. https://example.com/llms.txt) after build/deploy.
# - Use this file to expose a minimal, non-sensitive signal or configuration
#   about Large Language Model (LLM) integrations or related site capabilities.
# Typical uses:
# - Indicate whether LLM support is enabled for this site.
# - Provide non-sensitive metadata for crawlers or deployment tooling.
# - Provide a simple, deploy-time replaceable config that does NOT contain
#   secrets, API keys, or private endpoints.
# Format & examples:
# - Plain key/value pairs (recommended):
#     llms: present
#     provider: openai
#     version: 1
# - Or a single-line JSON object if preferred (still avoid secrets):
#     {"llms":true,"provider":"openai","version":1}
# Security note:
# - NEVER store secrets, API keys, credentials, or internal endpoints here.
#   This file is publicly accessible and intended only for non-sensitive info.
# Deployment note:
# - CI/CD or build scripts may overwrite this file with environment-specific
#   values. Keep it readable and simple so deployment systems can swap content.
