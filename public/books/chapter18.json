          "Actually the Bhagavad-gétä is finished in seventeen chapters. The, Eighteenth Chapter is a supplementary summarization of the topics discussed, before. In every chapter of Bhagavad-gétä, Lord Kåñëa stresses that devotional, service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate goal of life., This same point is summarized in the Eighteenth Chapter as the most, confidential path of knowledge. In the first six chapters, stress was given to, devotional service: yoginäm api sarveñäm… “Of all yogés or transcendentalists,, one who always thinks of Me within himself is best.” In the next six chapters,, pure devotional service and its nature and activity were discussed. In the third, six chapters, knowledge, renunciation, the activities of material nature and, transcendental nature, and devotional service were described. It was, concluded that all acts should be performed in conjunction with the Supreme, Lord, summarized by the words om tat sat, which indicate Viñëu, the Supreme, Person. In the third part of Bhagavad-gétä, devotional service was established, by the example of past äcäryas and the Brahma-sütra, the Vedänta-sütra, which, cites that devotional service is the ultimate purpose of life and nothing else., Certain impersonalists consider themselves monopolizers of the knowledge of, Vedänta-sütra, but actually the Vedänta-sütra is meant for understanding, devotional service, for the Lord Himself is the composer of the Vedänta-sütra,, and He is its knower. That is described in the Fifteenth Chapter. In every, scripture, every Veda, devotional service is the objective. That is explained in, Bhagavad-gétä., As in the Second Chapter a synopsis of the whole subject matter was, described, similarly, in the Eighteenth Chapter also the summary of all, instruction is given. The purpose of life is indicated to be renunciation and, attainment of the transcendental position above the three material modes of, nature. Arjuna wants to clarify the two distinct subject matters of Bhagavad-, gétä, namely renunciation (tyäga) and the renounced order of life (sannyäsa)., Thus he is asking the meaning of these two words., Two words used in this verse to address the Supreme Lord―Håñékeça and, Keçinisüdana―are significant. Håñékeça is Kåñëa, the master of all senses, who, can always help us attain mental serenity. Arjuna requests Him to summarize, everything in such a way that he can remain equiposed. Yet he has some, doubts, and doubts are always compared to demons. He therefore addresses, Kåñëa as Keçinisüdana. Keçé was a most formidable demon who was killed by, the Lord; now Arjuna is expecting Kåñëa to kill the demon of doubt."

Although animal, killing in a sacrifice is recommended in the Vedic literature, the animal is not, considered to be killed. The sacrifice is to give a new life to the animal., Sometimes the animal is given a new animal life after being killed in the, sacrifice, and sometimes the animal is promoted immediately to the human, form of life. But there are different opinions among the sages. Some say that, animal killing should always be avoided, and others say that for a specific, sacrifice it is good.

The Lord says here that any sacrifice which is meant, for human welfare should never be given up. Viväha-yajïa, the marriage, ceremony, is meant to regulate the human mind to become peaceful for, spiritual advancement. For most men, this viväha-yajïa should be encouraged, even by persons in the renounced order of life. Sannyasés should never, associate with women, but that does not mean that one who is in the lower, stages of life, a young man, should not accept a wife in the marriage ceremony., All prescribed sacrifices are meant for achieving the Supreme Lord. Therefore,, in the lower stages, they should not be given up. Similarly, charity is for the, purification of the heart.

These are declared in säìkhya philosophy to, be the place of action, the performer, the senses, the endeavor, and ultimately, the Supersoul., PURPORT, A question may be raised that since any activity performed must have some, reaction, how is it that the person in Kåñëa consciousness does not suffer or, enjoy the reactions of work? The Lord is citing Vedänta philosophy to show, how this is possible. He says that there are five causes for all activities and for, success in all activity, and one should know these five causes. Säìkhya means, the stalk of knowledge, and Vedänta is the final stalk of knowledge accepted by, all leading äcäryas. Even Çaìkara accepts Vedänta-sütra as such. Therefore, such authority should be consulted., The ultimate will is invested in the Supersoul, as it is stated in the Gétä,, “sarvasya cähaà hådi.” He is engaging everyone in certain activities. Acts done, under His direction from within yield no reaction, either in this life or in the, life after death., The instruments of action are the senses, and by senses the soul acts in various, ways, and for each and every action there is a different endeavor. But all one’s, activities depend on the will of the Supersoul, who is seated within the heart, as a friend. The Supreme Lord is the super cause. Under these circumstances,, he who is acting in Kåñëa consciousness under the direction of the Supersoul, situated within the heart is naturally not bound by any activity. Those in, complete Kåñëa consciousness are not ultimately responsible for their actions., Everything is dependant on the supreme will, the Supersoul, the Supreme, Personality of Godhead."

The, inspiration to work is the same if it comes from the scripture or from the, instruction of the spiritual master.

That which in the beginning may be just like poison, but at the end is just like nectar and which awakens one to self-realization is, said to be happiness in the mode of goodness., PURPORT, A conditioned soul tries to enjoy material happiness again and again. Thus, he chews the chewed, but, sometimes, in the course of such enjoyment, he, becomes relieved from material entanglement by association with a great soul., In other words, a conditioned soul is always engaged in some type of sense, gratification, but when he understands by good association that it is only a, repetition of the same thing, and he is awakened to his real Kåñëa, consciousness, he is sometimes relieved from such repetitive so-called, happiness., In the pursuit of self-realization, one has to follow many rules and regulations, to control the mind and the senses and to concentrate the mind on the Self., All these procedures are very difficult, bitter like poison, but if one is, successful in following the regulations and comes to the transcendental, position, he begins to drink real nectar, and he enjoys life."

And the Supreme Lord, by His two energies, His external energy and, internal energy, is all-pervading. Therefore one should worship the Supreme, Lord with His energies. Generally the Vaiñëava devotees worship the Supreme, Lord with His internal energy. His external energy is a perverted reflection of, the internal energy. The external energy is a background, but the Supreme, Lord by the expansion of His plenary portion as Paramätmä is situated, everywhere. He is the Supersoul of all demigods, all human beings, all animals,, everywhere. One should therefore know that as part and parcel of the, Supreme Lord it is his duty to render service unto the Supreme. Everyone, should be engaged in devotional service to the Lord in full Kåñëa, consciousness. That is recommended in this verse., Everyone should think that he is engaged in a particular type of occupation by, Håñékeça, the master of the senses. And, by the result of the work in which one, is engaged, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa, should be, worshiped. If one thinks always in this way, in full Kåñëa consciousness, then,, by the grace of the Lord, he becomes fully aware of everything. That is the, perfection of life. The Lord says in Bhagavad-gétä, teñäm ahaà samuddhartä., The Supreme Lord Himself takes charge of delivering such a devotee. That is, the highest perfection of life. In whatever occupation one may be engaged, if, he serves the Supreme Lord, he will achieve the highest perfection."

          "One’s occupational duty is prescribed in Bhagavad-gétä. As already discussed, in previous verses, the duties of a brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya and çüdra are, prescribed according to the particular modes of nature. One should not imitate, another’s duty. A man who is by nature attracted to the kind of work done by, çüdras should not artificially claim himself to be a brähmaëa, although he may, be born into a brähmaëa family. In this way one should work according to his, own nature; no work is abominable, if performed in the service of the Supreme, Lord. The occupational duty of a brähmaëa is certainly in the mode of, goodness, but if a person is not by nature in the mode of goodness, he should, not imitate the occupational duty of a brähmaëa. For a kñatriya, or, administrator, there are so many abominable things; a kñatriya has to be, violent to kill his enemies, and sometimes a kñatriya has to tell lies for the sake, of diplomacy. Such violence and duplicity accompany political affairs, but a, kñatriya is not supposed to give up his occupational duty and try to perform the, duties of a brähmaëa., One should act to satisfy the Supreme Lord. For example, Arjuna was a, kñatriya. He was hesitating to fight the other party. But if such fighting is, performed for the sake of Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there, need be no fear of degradation. In the business field also, sometimes a, merchant has to tell so many lies to make a profit. If he does not do so, there, can be no profit. Sometimes a merchant says, “Oh, my dear customer, for you I, am making no profit,” but one should know that without profit the merchant, cannot exist. Therefore it should be taken as a simple lie if a merchant says, that he is not making a profit. But the merchant should not think that because, he is engaged in an occupation in which the telling of lies is compulsory, he, should give up his profession and pursue the profession of a brähmaëa. That is, not recommended. Whether one is a kñatriya, a vaiçya, or a çüdra doesn’t, matter, if he serves, by his work, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even, brähmaëas, who perform different types of sacrifice, sometimes must kill, animals because sometimes animals are sacrificed in such ceremonies., Similarly, if a kñatriya engaged in his own occupation kills an enemy, there is, no sin incurred. In the Third Chapter these matters have been clearly and, elaborately explained; every man should work for the purpose of yajïa, or for, Viñëu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Anything done for personal sense, gratification is a cause of bondage. The conclusion is that everyone should be, engaged according to the particular mode of nature he has acquired, and he, should decide to work only to serve the supreme cause of the Supreme Lord."

          "In conditioned life, all work is contaminated by the material modes of, nature. Even if one is a brähmaëa, he has to perform sacrifices in which animal, killing is necessary. Similarly, a kñatriya, however pious he may be, has to fight, enemies. He cannot avoid it. Similarly, a merchant, however pious he may be,, must sometimes hide his profit to stay in business, or he may sometimes have, to do business on the black market. These things are necessary; one cannot, avoid them. Similarly, even though a man is a çüdra serving a bad master, he, has to carry out the order of the master, even though it should not be done., Despite these flaws, one should continue to carry out his prescribed duties, for, they are born out of his own nature., A very nice example is given herein. Although fire is pure, still there is smoke., Yet smoke does not make the fire impure. Even though there is smoke in the, fire, fire is still considered to be the purest of all elements. If one prefers to, give up the work of a kñatriya and take up the occupation of a brähmaëa, he is, not assured that in the occupation of a brähmaëa there are no unpleasant, duties. One may then conclude that in the material world no one can be, completely free from the contamination of material nature. This example of, fire and smoke is very appropriate in this connection. When in wintertime, one takes a stone from the fire, sometimes smoke disturbs the eyes and other, parts of the body, but still one must make use of the fire despite disturbing, conditions. Similarly, one should not give up his natural occupation because, there are some disturbing elements. Rather, one should be determined to serve, the Supreme Lord by his occupational duty in Kåñëa consciousness. That is the, perfectional point. When a particular type of occupation is performed for the, satisfaction of the Supreme Lord, all the defects in that particular occupation, are purified. When the results of work are purified, when connected with, devotional service, one becomes perfect in seeing the self within, and that is, self-realization."

Thus one becomes the controller of the mind and is always in, trance. Because he is not attached to the objects of sense gratification, he does, not eat more than what he requires, and he controls the activities of his body, and mind. He has no false ego because he does not accept the body as himself., Nor has he a desire to make the body fat and strong by accepting so many, material things. Because he has no bodily concept of life, he is not falsely, proud. He is satisfied with everything that is offered to him by the grace of the, Lord, and he is never angry in the absence of sense gratification. Nor does he, endeavor to acquire sense objects. Thus when he is completely free from false, ego, he becomes nonattached to all material things, and that is the stage of, self-realization of Brahman. That stage is called the brahma-bhüta stage. When, one is free from the material conception of life, he becomes peaceful and, cannot be agitated."

          "To the impersonalist, achieving the brahma-bhüta stage, becoming one with, the Absolute, is the last word. But for the personalist, or pure devotee, one has, to go still further to become engaged in pure devotional service. This means, that one who is engaged in pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord is, already in a state of liberation, called brahma-bhüta, oneness with the, Absolute. Without being one with the Supreme, the Absolute, one cannot, render service unto Him. In the absolute conception, there is no difference, between the served and the servitor; yet the distinction is there, in a higher, spiritual sense., In the material concept of life, when one works for sense gratification, there is, misery, but in the absolute world, when one is engaged in pure devotional, service, there is no misery. The devotee in Kåñëa consciousness has nothing to, lament or desire. Since God is full, a living entity who is engaged in God’s, service, in Kåñëa consciousness, becomes also full in himself. He is just like a, river cleansed of all dirty water. Because a pure devotee has no thought other, than Kåñëa, he is naturally always joyful. He does not lament for any material, loss or gain because he is full in service of the Lord. He has no desire for, material enjoyment because he knows that every living entity is the, fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord and therefore eternally a, servant. He does not see, in the material world, someone as higher and, someone as lower; higher and lower positions are ephemeral, and a devotee has, nothing to do with ephemeral appearances or disappearances. For him stone, and gold are of equal value. This is the brahma-bhüta stage, and this stage is, attained very easily by the pure devotee. In that stage of existence, the idea of, becoming one with the Supreme Brahman and annihilating one’s individuality, becomes hellish, and the idea of attaining the heavenly kingdom becomes, phantasmagoria, and the senses are like broken serpents’ teeth. As there is no, fear of a serpent with broken teeth, so there is no fear from the senses when, they are automatically controlled. The world is miserable for the materially, infected person, but for a devotee the entire world is as good as Vaikuëöha, or, the spiritual sky. The highest personality in this material universe is no more, significant than an ant for a devotee. Such a stage can be achieved by the, mercy of Lord Caitanya, who preached pure devotional service in this age."

          "The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, and His plenary portions, cannot be understood by mental speculation nor by the nondevotees. If, anyone wants to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he has to, take to pure devotional service under the guidance of a pure devotee., Otherwise, the truth of the Supreme Personality of Godhead will always be, hidden. It is already stated (nähaà prakäçaù) that He is not revealed to, everyone. Everyone cannot understand God simply by erudite scholarship or, mental speculation. Only one who is actually engaged in Kåñëa consciousness, and devotional service can understand what Kåñëa is. University degrees are, not helpful., One who is fully conversant with the Kåñëa science becomes eligible to enter, into the spiritual kingdom, the abode of Kåñëa. Becoming Brahman does not, mean that one loses his identity. Devotional service is there, and as long as, devotional service exists, there must be God, the devotee, and the process of, devotional service. Such knowledge is never vanquished, even after liberation., Liberation involves getting free from the concept of material life; in spiritual, life the same distinction is there, the same individuality is there, but in pure, Kåñëa consciousness. One should not misunderstand that the word viçate,, “enters into Me,” supports the monist theory that one becomes homogeneous, with the impersonal Brahman. No. Viçate means that one can enter into the, abode of the Supreme Lord in his individuality to engage in His association, and render service unto Him. For instance, a green bird enters a green tree not, to become one with the tree but to enjoy the fruits of the tree. Impersonalists, generally give the example of a river flowing into the ocean and merging. This, may be a source of happiness for the impersonalist, but the personalist keeps, his personal individuality like an aquatic in the ocean. We find so many living, entities within the ocean, if we go deep. Surface acquaintance with the ocean, is not sufficient; one must have complete knowledge of the aquatics living in, the ocean depths., Because of his pure devotional service, a devotee can understand the, transcendental qualities and the opulences of the Supreme Lord in truth. As it, is stated in the Eleventh Chapter, only by devotional service can one, understand. The same is confirmed here; one can understand the Supreme, Personality of Godhead by devotional service and enter into His kingdom., After attainment of the brahma-bhüta stage of freedom from material, conceptions, devotional service begins by one’s hearing about the Lord. When, one hears about the Supreme Lord, automatically the brahma-bhüta stage, develops, and material contamination―greediness and lust for sense, enjoyment―disappears. As lust and desires disappear from the heart of a, devotee, he becomes more attached to the service of the Lord, and by such, attachment he becomes free from material contamination. In that state of life, he can understand the Supreme Lord. This is the statement of Çrémad-, Bhägavatam also. Also after liberation the process of bhakti or transcendental, service continues. The Vedänta-sütra confirms this: äpräyaëät taträpi hi, dåñöam. This means that after liberation the process of devotional service, continues. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, real devotional liberation is defined as, the reinstatement of the living entity in his own identity, his own, constitutional position. The constitutional position is already explained: every, living entity is the part and parcel fragmental portion of the Supreme Lord., Therefore his constitutional position is to serve. After liberation, this service, is never stopped. Actual liberation is getting free from misconceptions of life."

          "When one acts in Kåñëa consciousness, he does not act as the master of the, world. Just like a servant, one should act fully under the direction of the, Supreme Lord. A servant has no individual independence. He acts only on the, order of the master. A servant acting on behalf of the supreme master has no, affection for profit and loss. He simply discharges his duty faithfully in terms, of the order of the Lord. Now, one may argue that Arjuna was acting under, the personal direction of Kåñëa, but, when Kåñëa is not present, how should, one act? If one acts according to the direction of Kåñëa in this book, as well as, under the guidance of the representative of Kåñëa, then the result will be the, same. The Sanskrit word mat-paraù is very important in this verse. It indicates, that one has no goal in life save and except acting in Kåñëa consciousness just, to satisfy Kåñëa. And, while working in that way, one should think of Kåñëa, only: “I have been appointed to discharge this particular duty by Kåñëa.”, While acting in such a way, one naturally has to think of Kåñëa. This is perfect, Kåñëa consciousness. One should, however, note that, after doing something, whimsically, he should not offer the result to the Supreme Lord. That sort of, duty is not in the devotional service of Kåñëa consciousness. One should act, according to the order of Krñna. This is a very important point. That order of, Kåñëa comes through disciplic succession from the bona fide spiritual master., Therefore the spiritual master’s order should be taken as the prime duty of life., If one gets a bona fide spiritual master and acts according to his direction,, then his perfection of life in Kåñëa consciousness is guaranteed."

But, due to false ego, he was fearing, that by killing his teacher, grandfather and friends, there would be sinful, reactions. Actually he was considering himself master of his actions, as if he, were directing the good and bad results of such work. He forgot that the, Supreme Personality of Godhead was present there, instructing him to fight., That is the forgetfulness of the conditioned soul. The Supreme Personality, gives directions as to what is good and what is bad, and one simply has to act in, Kåñëa consciousness to attain the perfection of life. No one can ascertain his, destiny as the Supreme Lord can; therefore the best course is to take direction, from the Supreme Lord and act. No one should neglect the order of the, Supreme Personality of Godhead or the order of the spiritual master who is, the representative of God. One should act unhesitatingly to execute the order, of the Supreme Personality of Godhead—that will keep him safe under all, circumstances."

After changing bodies, the living entity forgets his past deeds, but the, Supersoul, as the knower of the past, present and future, remains the witness, of all his activities. Therefore all the activities of living entities are directed by, this Supersoul. The living entity gets what he deserves and is carried by the, material body which is created in the material energy under the direction of, the Supersoul. As soon as a living entity is placed in a particular type of body,, he has to work under the spell of that bodily situation. A person seated in a, high-speed motor car goes faster than one seated in a slower car, though the, living entities, the drivers, may be the same. Similarly, by the order of the, Supreme Soul, material nature fashions a particular type of body to a, particular type of living entity to work according to his past desires. The living, entity is not independant. One should not think himself independant of the, Supreme Personality of Godhead. The individual is always under His control., Therefore his duty is to surrender, and that is the injunction of the next verse."

The transcendental world is described in the Vedic literature as, tad viñëoù paramaà padam. Since all of creation is the kingdom of God,, everything material is actually spiritual, but paramaà padam specifically refers, to the eternal abode, which is called the spiritual sky or Vaikuëöha., In the Fifteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä it is stated: “Sarvasya cäham hådi, sanniviñöaù.” The Lord is seated in everyone’s heart, so this recommendation, that one should surrender unto the Supersoul sitting within means that one, should surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. Kåñëa has, already been accepted by Arjuna as the Supreme. He was accepted in the, Tenth Chapter as paraà brahma paraà dhäma.

In Bhagavad-gétä,, the Lord has explained in all respects how one can elevate his living condition., The best advice imparted to Arjuna is to surrender unto the Supersoul seated, within his heart. By right discrimination, one should agree to act according to, the order of the Supersoul. That will help one become situated constantly in, Kåñëa consciousness, the highest perfectional stage of human life. Arjuna is, being directly ordered by the Personality of Godhead to fight.

          "The Lord has described various kinds of knowledge, processes of religion,, knowledge of the Supreme Brahman, knowledge of the Supersoul, knowledge, of the different types of orders and statuses of social life, knowledge of the, renounced order of life, knowledge of nonattachment, sense and mind control,, meditation, etc. He has described in so many ways different types of religion., Now, in summarizing Bhagavad-gétä, the Lord says that Arjuna should give up, all the processes that have been explained to him; he should simply surrender, to Kåñëa. That surrender will save him from all kinds of sinful reactions, for, the Lord personally promises to protect him., In the Eighth Chapter it was said that only one who has become free from all, sinful reactions can take to the worship of Lord Kåñëa. Thus one may think, that unless he is free from all sinful reactions he cannot take to the, surrendering process. To such doubts it is here said that even if one is not free, from all sinful reactions, simply by the process of surrendering to Çré Kåñëa he, is automatically freed. There is no need of strenuous effort to free oneself from, sinful reactions. One should unhesitatingly accept Kåñëa as the supreme savior, of all living entities. With faith and love, one should surrender unto Him., According to the devotional process, one should simply accept such religious, principles that will lead ultimately to the devotional service of the Lord. One, may perform a particular occupational duty according to his position in the, social order, but if by executing his duty one does not come to the point of, Kåñëa consciousness, all his activities are in vain., Anything that does not lead to the perfectional stage of Kåñëa consciousness, should be avoided. One should be confident that in all circumstances Kåñëa, will protect him from all difficulties. There is no need of thinking how one, should keep the body and soul together. Kåñëa will see to that. One should, always think himself helpless and should consider Kåñëa the only basis for his, progress in life. As soon as one seriously engages himself in devotional service, to the Lord in full Kåñëa consciousness, at once he becomes freed from all, contamination of material nature. There are different processes of religion and, purificatory processes by cultivation of knowledge, meditation in the mystic, yoga system, etc., but one who surrenders unto Kåñëa does not have to execute, so many methods. That simple surrender unto Kåñëa will save him from, unnecessarily wasting time. One can thus make all progress at once and be, freed from all sinful reaction., One should be attracted by the beautiful vision of Kåñëa. His name is Kåñëa, because He is all-attractive. One who becomes attracted by the beautiful, all-, powerful, omnipotent vision of Kåñëa is fortunate. There are different kinds of, transcendentalists―some of them are attached to the impersonal Brahman, vision, some of them are attracted by the Supersoul feature, etc., but one who, is attracted to the personal feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,, and, above all, one who is attracted by the Supreme Personality of Godhead as, Kåñëa Himself, is the most perfect transcendentalist. In other words,, devotional service to Kåñëa, in full consciousness, is the most confidential part, of knowledge, and this is the essence of the whole Bhagavad-gétä. Karma-yogés,, empiric philosophers, mystics, and devotees are all called transcendentalists,, but one who is a pure devotee is the best of all. The particular words used here,, mä çucaù, “Don’t fear, don’t hesitate, don’t worry,” are very significant. One, may be perplexed as to how one can give up all kinds of religious forms and, simply surrender unto Kåñëa, but such worry is useless."

There is no, possibility of faithless persons’ understanding Bhagavad-gétä and Kåñëa., Without understanding Kåñëa from the authority of a pure devotee, one, should not try to comment upon Bhagavad-gitä."

In other words, Bhagavad-, gétä is for the devotees only, but it so happens that sometimes a devotee of the, Lord will hold open class, and in that class all the students are not expected to, be devotees. Why do such persons hold open class? It is explained here that, although everyone is not a devotee, still there are many men who are not, envious of Kåñëa. They have faith in Him as the Supreme Personality of, Godhead. If such persons hear from a bona fide devotee about the Lord, the, result is that they become at once free from all sinful reactions and after that, attain to the planetary system where all righteous persons are situated., Therefore simply by hearing Bhagavad-gétä, even a person who does not try to, be a pure devotee attains the result of righteous activities. Thus a pure devotee, of the Lord gives everyone a chance to become free from all sinful reactions, and to become a devotee of the Lord., Generally those who are free from sinful reaction are righteous. Such persons, very easily take to Kåñëa consciousness. The word puëya-karmaëäm is very, significant here. This refers to the performance of great sacrifice. Those who, are righteous in performing devotional service but who are not pure can attain, the planetary system of the polestar, or Dhruvaloka, where Dhruva Mahäräja, is presiding. He is a great devotee of the Lord, and he has a special planet, which is called the polestar."

          "The constitutional position of a living entity, represented by Arjuna, is that, he has to act according to the order of the Supreme Lord. He is meant for self-, discipline. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu says that the actual position of the living, entity is that of eternal servant of the Supreme Lord. Forgetting this principle,, the living entity becomes conditioned by material nature, but in serving the, Supreme Lord, he becomes the liberated servant of God. The living entity’s, constitutional position is to be servitor; he either has to serve the illusory mäyä, or the Supreme Lord. If he serves the Supreme Lord, he is in his normal, condition, but if he prefers to serve the illusory external energy, then certainly, he will be in bondage. In illusion the living entity is serving in this material, world. He is bound by his lust and desires, yet he thinks of himself as the, master of the world. This is called illusion. When a person is liberated, his, illusion is over, and he voluntarily surrenders unto the Supreme to act, according to His desires. The last illusion, the last snare of mäyä to trap the, living entity, is the proposition that he is God. The living entity thinks that he, is no longer a conditioned soul, but God. He is so unintelligent that he does, not think that if he were God, then how could he be in doubt? That he does, not consider. So that is the last snare of illusion. Actually to become free from, the illusory energy is to understand Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of, Godhead, and agree to act according to His order. The word mohaù is very, important in this verse. Mohaù refers to that which is opposed to knowledge., Actually real knowledge is the understanding that every living being is, eternally servitor of the Lord, but instead of thinking oneself in that position,, the living entity thinks that he is not servant, that he is the master of this, material world, for he wants to lord it over the material nature. That is his, illusion. This illusion can be overcome by the mercy of the Lord or by the, mercy of a pure devotee. When that illusion is over, one agrees to act in Kåñëa, consciousness., Kåñëa consciousness is acting according to Kåñëa’s order. A conditioned soul, illusioned by the external energy of matter does not know that the Supreme, Lord is the master who is full of knowledge and who is the proprietor of, everything. Whatever He desires He can bestow upon His devotees; He is the, friend of everyone, and He is especially inclined to His devotee. He is the, controller of this material nature and of all living entities. He is also the, controller of inexhaustible time, and He is full of all opulences and all, potencies. The Supreme Personality of Godhead can even give Himself to the, devotee. One who does not know Him is under the spell of illusion; he does, not become a devotee, but a servitor of mäyä. Arjuna, however, after hearing, Bhagavad-gétä from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, became free from all, illusion. He could understand that Kåñëa was not only his friend, but the, Supreme Personality of Godhead. And he understood Kåñëa factually. So to, study Bhagavad-gétä is to understand Kåñëa factually. When a person is in full, knowledge, he naturally surrenders to Kåñëa. When Arjuna understood that it, was Kåñëa’s plan to reduce the unnecessary increase of population, he agreed, to fight according to Kåñëa’s desire. He again took up his weapons―his arrows, and bow―to fight under the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

          "Vyäsa was the spiritual master of Saïjaya, and Saïjaya admits that it was by, his mercy that he could understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This, means that one has to understand Kåñëa not directly but through the medium, of the spiritual master. The spiritual master is the transparent medium,, although it is true that the experience is direct. This is the mystery of the, disciplic succession. When the spiritual master is bona fide, then one can hear, Bhagavad-gétä directly, as Arjuna heard it. There are many mystics and yogés, all over the world, but Kåñëa is the master of all yoga systems. Kåñëa’s, instruction is explicitly stated in Bhagavad-gétä—surrender unto Krñëa. One, who does so is the topmost yogé. This is confirmed in the last verse of the Sixth, Chapter. Yoginäm api sarveñäm., Närada is the direct disciple of Kåñëa and the spiritual master of Vyäsa., Therefore Vyäsa is as bona fide as Arjuna because he comes in the disciplic, succession, and Saïjaya is the direct disciple of Vyäsa. Therefore by the grace, of Vyäsa, his senses were purified, and he could see and hear Kåñëa directly., One who directly hears Kåñëa can understand this confidential knowledge. If, one does not come to the disciplic succession, he cannot hear Kåñëa; therefore, his knowledge is always imperfect, at least as far as understanding Bhagavad-, gétä is concerned., In Bhagavad-gétä, all the yoga systems, karma-yoga, jïäna-yoga and bhakti-yoga,, are explained. Kåñëa is the master of all such mysticism. It is to be understood,, however, that as Arjuna was fortunate enough to understand Kåñëa directly,, similarly, by the grace of Vyäsa, Saïjaya was also able to hear Kåñëa directly., Actually there is no difference in hearing directly from Kåñëa or hearing, directly from Kåñëa via a bona fide spiritual master like Vyäsa. The spiritual, master is the representative of Vyäsadeva also. According to the Vedic system,, on the birthday of the spiritual master, the disciples conduct the ceremony, called Vyäsa-püjä."

It was exhibited to Arjuna only, yet some great, devotees could also see the universal form of Kåñëa when it was shown to, Arjuna, and Vyäsa was one of them. He is one of the great devotees of the, Lord, and he is considered to be a powerful incarnation of Kåñëa.

          "The Bhagavad-gétä began with an inquiry of Dhåtaräñöra. He was hopeful of, the victory of his sons, assisted by great warriors like Bhéñma, Droëa and, Karëa. He was hopeful that the victory would be on his side. But, after, describing the scene in the battlefield, Saïjaya told the King, “You are, thinking of victory, but my opinion is that where Kåñëa and Arjuna are, present, there will be all good fortune.” He directly confirmed that Dhåtaräñöra, could not expect victory for his side. Victory was certain for the side of Arjuna, because Kåñëa was there. Kåñëa’s acceptance of the post of charioteer for, Arjuna was an exhibition of another opulence. Kåñëa is full of all opulences,, and renunciation is one of them. There are many instances of such, renunciation, for Kåñëa is also the master of renunciation., The fight was actually between Duryodhana and Yudhiñöhira. Arjuna was, fighting on behalf of his elder brother, Yudhiñöhira. Because Kåñëa and Arjuna, were on the side of Yudhiñöhira, Yudhiñöhira’s victory was certain. The battle, was to decide who would rule the world, and Saïjaya predicted that the power, would be transferred to Yudhiñöhira. It is also predicted here that Yudhiñöhira,, after gaining victory in this battle, would flourish more and more because he, was not only righteous and pious, but he was a strict moralist. He never spoke a, lie during his life., There are many less intelligent persons who take Bhagavad-gétä to be a, discussion of topics between two friends in a battlefield. But such a book, cannot be scripture. Some may protest that Kåñëa incited Arjuna to fight,, which is immoral, but the reality of the situation is clearly stated: Bhagavad-, gétä is the supreme instruction in morality. The supreme instruction of, morality is stated in the Ninth Chapter, in the thirty-fourth verse: manmanä, bhava mad-bhaktaù. One must become a devotee of Kåñëa, and the essence of, all religion is to surrender unto Kåñëa, as stated, Sarva-dharmän. The, instructions of Bhagavad-gétä constitute the supreme process of religion and of, morality. All other processes may be purifying and may lead to this process, but, the last instruction of the Gétä is the last word in all morality and religion:, surrender unto Kåñëa. This is the verdict of the Eighteenth Chapter., From Bhagavad-gétä we can understand that to realize oneself by philosophical, speculation and by meditation is one process, but to fully surrender unto Kåñëa, is the highest perfection. This is the essence of the teachings of Bhagavad-gétä., The path of regulative principles according to the orders of social life and, according to the different courses of religion may be a confidential path of, knowledge in as far as the rituals of religion are confidential, but one is still, involved with meditation and cultivation of knowledge. Surrender unto Kåñëa, in devotional service in full Kåñëa consciousness is the most confidential, instruction and is the essence of the Eighteenth Chapter., Another feature of Bhagavad-gétä is that the actual truth is the Supreme, Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. Absolute Truth is realized in three, features―impersonal Brahman, localized Paramätmä, and the Supreme, Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. Perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth, means perfect knowledge of Kåñëa. If one understands Kåñëa, then all the, departments of knowledge are part and parcel of that understanding. Kåñëa is, transcendental, for He is always situated in His eternal internal potency. The, living entities are manifested and are divided into two classes, eternally, conditioned and eternally liberated. Such living entities are innumerable, and, they are considered fundamental parts of Kåñëa. Material energy is manifested, into twenty-four divisions. The creation is effected by eternal time, and it is, created and dissolved by external energy. This manifestation of the cosmic, world repeatedly becomes visible and invisible., In Bhagavad-gétä five principal subject matters have been discussed: the, Supreme Personality of Godhead, material nature, the living entities, eternal, time and all kinds of activities. All of these are dependant on the Supreme, Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. All conceptions of the Absolute Truth,, namely, impersonal Brahman, localized Paramätmä, or any other, transcendental conception, exist within the category of understanding the, Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although superficially the Supreme, Personality of Godhead, the living entity, material nature and time appear to, be different, nothing is different from the Supreme. But the Supreme is always, different from everything. Lord Caitanya’s philosophy is that of, “inconceivably one and different.” This system of philosophy constitutes, perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth., The living entity in his original position is pure spirit. He is just like an atomic, particle of the Supreme Spirit. The conditioned living entity, however, is the, marginal energy of the Lord; he tends to be in contact with both the material, energy and the spiritual energy. In other words, the living entity is situated, between the two energies of the Lord, and because he belongs to the superior, energy of the Lord, he has a particle of independence. By proper use of that, independence he comes under the direct order of Kåñëa. Thus he attains his, normal condition in the pleasure-giving potency., Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Eighteenth Chapter of the, Çrémad-Bhagavad-gétä in the matter of its Conclusions—the Perfection of, Renunciation.]"
