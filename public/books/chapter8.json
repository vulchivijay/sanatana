        "spiritual nature. Therefore he is called the Supreme Lord’s marginal energy.,",
        "According to his identification with material or spiritual nature, he receives a,",
        "material or spiritual body. In material nature he may take a body from any of,",
        "the 8,400,000 species of life, but in spiritual nature he has only one body. In,",
        "material nature he is sometimes manifested as a man, demigod, an animal, a,",
        "beast, bird, etc., according to his karma. To attain material heavenly planets,",
        "and enjoy their facilities, he sometimes performs sacrifices (yajïa), but when,",

        "transformed into semen, which impregnates a woman, and thus the living,",
        "entity once again attains the human form to perform sacrifice and so repeat,",
        "the same cycle. In this way, the living entity perpetually comes and goes on the,",
        "material path. The Kåñëa conscious person, however, avoids such sacrifices. He,",
        "takes directly to Kåñëa consciousness and thereby prepares himself to return to,",

        "Impersonalist commentators on the Gétä unreasonably assume that Brahman,",
        "takes the form of jéva in the material world, and to substantiate this they refer,",
        "to Chapter Fifteen, verse 7, of the Gétä. But this verse also speaks of the living,",
        "entity as “an eternal fragment of Myself.” The fragment of God, the living,",
        "entity, may fall down into the material world, but the Supreme Lord (Acyuta),",
        "never falls down. Therefore this assumption that the Supreme Brahman,",
        "assumes the form of jéva is not acceptable. It is important to remember that in,",

        "This verse is the summation of the Seventh and Eighth Chapters,,",
        "particularly as the chapters deal with Kåñëa consciousness and devotional,",
        "service. One has to study the Vedas under the guidance of the spiritual master,",
        "and undergo many austerities and penances while living under his care. A,",
        "brahmacäré has to live in the home of the spiritual master just like a servant,,",
        "and he must beg alms from door to door and bring them to the spiritual master.,",
        "He takes food only under the master’s order, and if the master neglects to call,",
        "the student for food that day, the student fasts. These are some of the Vedic,",
        "principles for observing brahmacarya.,",
        "After the student studies the Vedas under the master for a period from five to,",
        "twenty years, he may become a man of perfect character. Study of the Vedas is,",
        "not meant for the recreation of armchair speculators, but for the formation of,",
        "character. After this training, the brahmacäré is allowed to enter into,",
        "household life and marry. When he is a householder, he also has to perform,",
        "many sacrifices and strive for further enlightenment. Then after retiring from,",
        "household life, upon accepting the order of vänaprastha, he undergoes severe,",
        "penances, such as living in forests, dressing with tree bark, not shaving, etc. By,",
        "carrying out the orders of brahmacäré, householder, vänaprastha and finally,",
        "sannyäsa, one becomes elevated to the perfectional stage of life. Some are then,",
        "elevated to the heavenly kingdoms, and when they become even more,",
        "advanced they are liberated in the spiritual sky, either in the impersonal,",
        "brahmajyoti or in the Vaikuëöha planets or Kåñëaloka. This is the path,",
        "outlined by Vedic literatures.,",
        "The beauty of Kåñëa consciousness, however, is that by one stroke, by engaging,",
        "in devotional service, one can surpass all rituals of the different orders of life.,",
        "One should try to understand the Seventh and Eighth Chapters of the Gétä,",
        "not by scholarship or mental speculation, but by hearing them in association,",
        "with pure devotees. Chapters Six through Twelve are the essence of the Gétä.,",
        "If one is fortunate to understand the Gétä―especially these middle six,",
        "chapters―in the association of devotees, then his life at once becomes,",
        "glorified beyond all penances, sacrifices, charities, speculations, etc. One,",
        "should hear the Gétä from the devotee because at the beginning of the Fourth,",
        "Chapter it is stated that the Géta can only be perfectly understood by devotees.,",
        "Hearing the Gétä from devotees, not from mental speculators, is called faith.,",
        "Through association of devotees, one is placed in devotional service, and by,",
        "this service Kåñëa’s activities, form, pastimes, name, etc., become clear, and all,",
        "misgivings are dispelled. Then once doubts are removed, the study of the Gétä,",
        "becomes extremely pleasurable, and one develops a taste and feeling for Kåñëa,",
        "consciousness. In the advanced stage, one falls completely in love with Kåñëa,,",
        "and that is the beginning of the highest perfectional stage of life which,",
