          "In the Fourth Chapter, thirty-ninth verse, it is said that a person faithful to, a particular type of worship gradually becomes elevated to the stage of, knowledge and attains the highest perfectional stage of peace and prosperity., In the Sixteenth Chapter, it is concluded that one who does not follow the, principles laid down in the scriptures is called an asura, demon, and one who, follows the scriptural injunctions faithfully is called a deva, or demigod. Now,, if one, with faith, follows some rules which are not mentioned in the scriptural, injunctions, what is his position? This doubt of Arjuna is to be cleared by, Kåñëa. Are those who create some sort of God by selecting a human being and, placing their faith in him worshiping in goodness, passion or ignorance? Do, such persons attain the perfectional stage of life? Is it possible for them to be, situated in real knowledge and elevate themselves to the highest perfectional, stage? Do those who do not follow the rules and regulations of the scriptures, but who have faith in something and worship gods and demigods and men, attain success in their effort? Arjuna is putting these questions to Kåñëa."

According to their previous, activities in the modes of goodness, passion or ignorance, they acquire a nature, which is of a specific quality. The association of the living entity with the, different modes of nature has been going on perpetually since the living entity, is in contact with material nature. Thus he acquires different types of, mentality according to his association with the material modes. But this nature, can be changed if one associates with a bona fide spiritual master and abides, by his rules and the scriptures. Gradually, one can change his position from, ignorance to goodness, or from passion to goodness. The conclusion is that, blind faith in a particular mode of nature cannot help a person become, elevated to the perfectional stage. One has to consider things carefully, with, intelligence, in the association of a bona fide spiritual master. Thus one can, change his position to a higher mode of nature."

          "Everyone has a particular type of faith, regardless of what he is. But his, faith is considered good, passionate or ignorant according to the nature he has, acquired. Thus, according to his particular type of faith, one associates with, certain persons. Now the real fact is that every living being, as is stated in the, Fifteenth Chapter, is originally the fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme, Lord. Therefore one is originally transcendental to all the modes of material, nature. But when one forgets his relationship with the Supreme Personality of, Godhead and comes into contact with the material nature in conditional life,, he generates his own position by association with the different varieties of, material nature. The resultant artificial faith and existence are only material., Although one may be conducted by some impression, or some conception of, life, still, originally, he is nirguëa, or transcendental. Therefore one has to, become cleansed of the material contamination that he has acquired in order, to regain his relationship with the Supreme Lord. That is the only path back, without fear: Kåñëa consciousness. If one is situated in Kåñëa consciousness,, then that path is guaranteed for his elevation to the perfectional stage. If one, does not take to this path of self-realization, then he is surely to be conducted, by the influence of the modes of nature., The word sattva, or faith, is very significant in this verse. Sattva or faith always, comes out of the works of goodness. One’s faith may be in a demigod or some, created God or some mental concoction. It is supposed to be one’s strong faith, in something that is productive of the works of material goodness. But in, material conditional life, no works of material nature are completely purified., They are mixed. They are not in pure goodness. Pure goodness is, transcendental; in purified goodness one can understand the real nature of the, Supreme Personality of Godhead. As long as one’s faith is not completely in, purified goodness, the faith is subject to contamination by any of the modes of, material nature. The contaminated modes of material nature expand to the, heart. Therefore according to the position of the heart in contact with a, particular mode of material nature, one’s faith is established. It should be, understood, that if one’s heart is in the mode of goodness, his faith is also in, the mode of goodness. If his heart is in the mode of passion, his faith is also in, the mode of passion. And if his heart is in the mode of darkness, illusion, his, faith is also thus contaminated. Thus we find different types of faith in this, world, and there are different types of religions due to different types of faith., The real principle of religious faith is situated in the mode of pure goodness,, but because the heart is tainted, we find different types of religious principles., Thus according to different types of faith, there are different kinds of worship."

          "In this verse the Supreme Personality of Godhead describes different kinds, of worshipers according to their external activities. According to scriptural, injunction, only the Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshipable, but those, who are not very conversant with, or faithful to, the scriptural injunctions, worship different objects, according to their specific situations in the modes of, material nature. Those who are situated in goodness generally worship the, demigods. The demigods include Brahmä, Çiva and others such as Indra,, Candra and the sun-god. There are various demigods. Those in goodness, worship a particular demigod for a particular purpose. Similarly, those who are, in the mode of passion worship the demons. We recall that during the Second, World War, a man in Calcutta worshiped Hitler because thanks to that war he, had amassed a large amount of wealth by dealing in the black market., Similarly, those in the modes of passion and ignorance generally select a, powerful man to be God. They think that anyone can be worshiped as God, and that the same results will be obtained., Now, it is clearly described here that those who are in the mode of passion, worship and create such gods, and those who are in the mode of ignorance, in, darkness, worship dead spirits. Sometimes people worship at the tomb of some, dead man. Sexual service is also considered to be in the mode of darkness., Similarly, in remote villages in India there are worshipers of ghosts. We have, seen that in India the lower class people sometimes go to the forest, and if they, have knowledge that a ghost lives in a tree, they worship that tree and offer, sacrifices. These different kinds of worship are not actually God worship. God, worship is for persons who are transcendentally situated in pure goodness. In, the Çrémad-Bhägavatam it is said, sattvaà viçuddham väsudeva-çabditam., “When a man is situated in pure goodness, he worships Väsudeva.” The, purport is that those who are completely purified of the material modes of, nature and who are transcendentally situated can worship the Supreme, Personality of Godhead., The impersonalists are supposed to be situated in the mode of goodness, and, they worship five kinds of demigods. They worship the impersonal Viñëu, or, Viñëu form in the material world, which is known as philosophized Viñëu., Viñëu is the expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the, impersonalists, because they do not ultimately believe in the Supreme, Personality of Godhead, imagine that the Viñëu form is just another aspect of, the impersonal Brahman; similarly, they imagine that Lord Brahmä is the, impersonal form in the material mode of passion. Thus they sometimes, describe five kinds of gods that are worshipable, but because they think that, the actual truth is impersonal Brahman, they dispose of all worshipable objects, at the ultimate end. In conclusion, the different qualities of the material, modes of nature can be purified through association with persons who are of, transcendental nature., TEXTS 5–6, AXaañivihTa& gaaer& TaPYaNTae Yae TaPaae JaNaa ), dM>aahªarSa&Yau¢-a k-aMaraGabl/aiNvTaa )) 5 )), k-zRYaNTa XarqrSQa& >aUTaGa]aMaMaceTaSa ), Maa& cEvaNTa XarqrSQa& TaaiNvÖyaSauriNaêYaaNa( )) 6 )), açästra-vihitaà ghoraà, tapyante ye tapo janäù, dambhähaìkära-saàyuktäù, käma-räga-balänvitäù, karñayantaù çaréra-sthaà, bhüta-grämam acetasaù, mäà caiväntaù çaréra-sthaà, tän viddhy äsura-niçcayän, açästra—not mentioned in the scriptures; vihitam—directed; ghoram—, harmful to others; tapyante—undergo penances; ye—those; tapaù—austerities;, janäù—persons; dambha—pride; ahaìkära—egotism; saàyuktäù—engaged;, käma—lust; räga—attachment; bala—force; anvitäù—impelled by;, karñayantaù—tormenting; çaréra-stham—situated within the body;, bhütagrämam—combination of material elements; acetasaù—by such a misled, mentality; mäm—to Me; ca—also; eva—certainly; antaù—within; çaréra-, stham—situated in the body; tän—them; viddhi—understand; äsura—demons;, niçcayän—certainly., TRANSLATION, Those who undergo severe austerities and penances not recommended in the, scriptures, performing them out of pride, egotism, lust and attachment, who are, impelled by passion and who torture their bodily organs as well as the Supersoul, dwelling within are to be known as demons., PURPORT, There are persons who manufacture modes of austerity and penances which, are not mentioned in the scriptural injunctions. For instance, fasting for some, ulterior purpose, such as to promote a purely political end, is not mentioned in, the scriptural directions. The scriptures recommend fasting for spiritual, advancement, not for some political end or social purpose. Persons who take to, such austerities are, according to Bhagavad-gétä, certainly demoniac. Their acts, are against the scriptural injunction and are not beneficial for the people in, general. Actually, they act out of pride, false ego, lust and attachment for, material enjoyment. By such activities, not only are the combination of, material elements of which the body is constructed disturbed, but also the, Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself living within the body. Such, unauthorized fasting or austerities for some political end are certainly very, disturbing to others. They are not mentioned in the Vedic literature. A, demoniac person may think that he can force his enemy or other parties to, comply with his desire by this method, but sometimes one dies by such fasting., These acts are not approved by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He, says that those who engage in them are demons. Such demonstrations are, insults to the Supreme Personality of Godhead because they are enacted in, disobedience to the Vedic scriptural injunctions. The word acetasaù is, significant in this connection—persons of normal mental condition must obey, the scriptural injunctions. Those who are not in such a position neglect and, disobey the scriptures and manufacture their own way of austerities and, penances. One should always remember the ultimate end of the demoniac, people, as described in the previous chapter. The Lord forces them to take, birth in the womb of demoniac persons. Consequently they will live by, demoniac principles life after life without knowing their relationship with the, Supreme Personality of Godhead. If, however, such persons are fortunate, enough to be guided by a spiritual master who can direct them to the path of, Vedic wisdom, they can get out of this entanglement and ultimately achieve, the supreme goal."

In the past, great authorities, selected those foods that best aid health and increase life’s duration, such as, milk products, sugar, rice, wheat, fruits and vegetables. These foods are very, dear to those in the mode of goodness. Some other foods, such as baked corn, and molasses, while not very palatable in themselves, can be made pleasant, when mixed with milk or other foods. They are then in the mode of goodness., All these foods are pure by nature. They are quite distinct from untouchable, things like meat and liquor. Fatty foods, as mentioned in the eighth verse,, have no connection with animal fat obtained by slaughter. Animal fat is, available in the form of milk, which is the most wonderful of all foods. Milk,, butter, cheese and similar products give animal fat in a form which rules out, any need for the killing of innocent creatures. It is only through brute, mentality that this killing goes on. The civilized method of obtaining needed, fat is by milk. Slaughter is the way of subhumans. Protein is amply available, through split peas, dhall, whole wheat, etc., Foods in the mode of passion, which are bitter, too salty, or too hot or overly, mixed with red pepper, cause misery by producing mucous in the stomach,, leading to disease. Foods in the mode of ignorance or darkness are essentially, those that are not fresh. Any food cooked more than three hours before it is, eaten (except prasädam, food offered to the Lord) is considered to be in the, mode of darkness. Because they are decomposing, such foods give a bad odor,, which often attracts people in this mode but repulses those in the mode of, goodness., Remnants of food may be eaten only when they are part of a meal that was, first offered to the Supreme Lord or first eaten by saintly persons, especially, the spiritual master. Otherwise the remnants of food are considered to be in, the mode of darkness, and they increase infection or disease. Such foodstuffs,, although very palatable to persons in the mode of darkness, are neither liked, nor even touched by those in the mode of goodness. The best food is the, remnant of what is offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In, Bhagavad-gétä the Supreme Lord says that He accepts preparations of, vegetables, flour and milk when offered with devotion. Patraà puñpaà phalaà, toyam. Of course, devotion and love are the chief things which the Supreme, Personality of Godhead accepts. But it is also mentioned that the prasädam, should be prepared in a particular way. Any food prepared by the injunction of, the scripture offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be taken, even if prepared long, long ago, because such food is transcendental. Therefore, to make food antiseptic, eatable and palatable for all persons, one should offer, food to the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

Everyone, thinks that there is no use in going to the temple just to worship God. But, worship for economic benefit is not recommended in the scriptural injunction., One should go simply to offer respect to the Deity. That will place one in the, mode of goodness. It is the duty of every civilized man to obey the injunctions, of the scriptures and offer respect to the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

To purify one’s, nature is to become Kåñëa conscious. Satisfaction of the mind can be obtained, only by taking the mind away from thoughts of sense enjoyment. The more we, think of sense enjoyment, the more the mind becomes dissatisfied. In the, present age we unnecessarily engage the mind in so many different ways for, sense gratification, and so there is no possibility of the mind’s becoming, satisfied. The best course is to divert the mind to the Vedic literature, which is, full of satisfying stories, as in the Puräëas and the Mahäbhärata. One can take, advantage of this knowledge and thus become purified. The mind should be, devoid of duplicity, and one should think of the welfare of all. Silence means, that one is always thinking of self-realization. The person in Kåñëa, consciousness observes perfect silence in this sense. Control of the mind, means detaching the mind from sense enjoyment. One should be, straightforward in his dealing and thereby purify his existence. All these, qualities together constitute austerity in mental activities."

          "It has been explained that penance, sacrifice, charity and foods are divided, into three categories: the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. But, whether first class, second class or third class, they are all conditioned,, contaminated by the material modes of nature. When they are aimed at the, Supreme—om tat sat, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the eternal—they, become means for spiritual elevation. In the scriptural injunctions such an, objective is indicated. These three words, om tat sat, particularly indicate the, Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the Vedic hymns,, the word om is always found., One who acts without following the regulations of the scriptures will not, attain the Absolute Truth. He will get some temporary result, but not the, ultimate end of life. The conclusion is that the performance of charities,, sacrifice and penance must be done in the mode of goodness. Performed in the, modes of passion or ignorance, they are certainly inferior in quality. The three, words om tat sat are uttered in conjunction with the holy name of the, Supreme Lord, e.g., om tad viñëoù. Whenever a Vedic hymn or the holy name, of the Supreme Lord is uttered, om is added. This is the indication of Vedic, literature. These three words are taken from Vedic hymns. Om ity etad, brahmaëo nediñöaà näma indicates the first goal. Then tattvamasi indicates the, second goal. And sad eva saumya indicates the third goal. Combined they, become om tat sat. Formerly when Brahmä, the first created living entity,, performed sacrifices, he spoke these three names of the Supreme Personality of, Godhead. The same principle holds by disciplic succession. So this hymn has, great significance. Bhagavad-gétä recommends, therefore, that any work done, should be done for om tat sat, or for the Supreme Personality of Godhead., When one performs penance, charity, and sacrifice with these three words, he, is acting in Krñna consciousness. Kåñëa consciousness is a scientific execution, of transcendental activities which enables one to return home, back to, Godhead. There is no loss of energy in acting in such a transcendental way."

Such, purificatory processes are adopted for the ultimate liberation of the living, entity. In all such activities it is recommended that one should vibrate om tat, sat. The words sad-bhäve and sädhu-bhäve indicate the transcendental, situation. One who is acting in Kåñëa consciousness is called sattva, and one, who is fully conscious of activities in Kåñëa consciousness is called svarüpa. In, the Çrémad-Bhägavatam it is said that the transcendental subject matter, becomes clear in the association of the devotees. Without good association,, one cannot achieve transcendental knowledge. When initiating a person or, offering the sacred thread, one vibrates the words om tat sat. Similarly, in all, kinds of yogic performances, the supreme object, om tat sat is invoked. These, words om tat sat are used to perfect all activities. This supreme om tat sat, makes everything complete."

          "Anything done without the transcendental objective—whether it be, sacrifice, charity or penance-is useless. Therefore, in this verse, it is declared, that such activities are abominable. Everything should be done for the, Supreme in Kåñëa consciousness. Without such faith, and without the proper, guidance, there can never be any fruit. In all the Vedic scriptures, faith in the, Supreme is advised. In the pursuit of all Vedic instructions, the ultimate goal is, the understanding of Kåñëa. No one can obtain success without following this, principle. Therefore, the best course is to work from the very beginning in, Kåñëa consciousness under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master. That is, the way to make everything successful., In the conditional state, people are attracted to worship demigods, ghosts, or, Yakñas like Kuvera. The mode of goodness is better than the modes of passion, and ignorance, but one who takes directly to Kåñëa consciousness is, transcendental to all three modes of material nature. Although there is a, process of gradual elevation, if one, by the association of pure devotees, takes, directly to Kåñëa consciousness, that is the best way. And that is recommended, in this chapter. To achieve success in this way, one must first find the proper, spiritual master and receive training under his direction. Then one can, achieve faith in the Supreme. When that faith matures, in course of time, it is, called love of God. This love is the ultimate goal of the living entities. One, should, therefore, take to Krñëa consciousness directly. That is the message of, this Seventeenth Chapter., Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Seventeenth Chapter of the, Çrémad-Bhagavad-gétä in the matter of the Divisions of Faith.]"
