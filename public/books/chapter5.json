          "In this Fifth Chapter of the Bhagavad-gétä, the Lord says that work in, devotional service is better than dry mental speculation. Devotional service is, easier than the latter because, being transcendental in nature, it frees one, from reaction. In the Second Chapter, preliminary knowledge of the soul and, its entanglement in the material body were explained. How to get out of this, material encagement by buddhi-yoga, or devotional service, was also explained, therein. In the Third Chapter, it was explained that a person who is situated, on the platform of knowledge no longer has any duties to perform. And, in the, Fourth Chapter, the Lord told Arjuna that all kinds of sacrificial work, culminate in knowledge. However, at the end of the Fourth Chapter, the Lord, advised Arjuna to wake up and fight, being situated in perfect knowledge., Therefore, by simultaneously stressing the importance of both work in, devotion and inaction in knowledge, Kåñëa has perplexed Arjuna and, confused his determination. Arjuna understands that renunciation in, knowledge involves cessation of all kinds of work performed as sense activities., But if one performs work in devotional service, then how is work stopped? In, other words, he thinks that sannyäsam, or renunciation in knowledge, should, be altogether free from all kinds of activity because work and renunciation, appear to him to be incompatible. He appears not to have understood that, work in full knowledge is nonreactive and is therefore the same as inaction., He inquires, therefore, whether he should cease work altogether, or work with, full knowledge."

          "Fruitive activities (seeking sense gratification) are cause for material, bondage. As long as one is engaged in activities aimed at improving the, standard of bodily comfort, one is sure to transmigrate to different types of, bodies, thereby continuing material bondage perpetually. Çrémad-Bhägavatam, confirms this as follows:, nünaà pramattaù kurute vikarma yad indriya-prétaya äpåëoti, na sädhu manye yata ätmano ’yam asann api kleçada äsa dehaù, paräbhavas tävad abodha-jäto yävanna jijïäsata ätma-tattvam, yävat kriyäs tävad idaà mano vai karmätmakaà yena çaréra-bandhaù, evaà manaù karma-vaçaà prayuìkte avidyayätmany upadhéyamäne, prétir na yävan mayi väsudeve na mucyate deha-yogena tävat, People are mad after sense gratification, and they do not know that this, present body, which is full of miseries, is a result of one’s fruitive activities in, the past. Although this body is temporary, it is always giving one trouble in, many ways. Therefore, to act for sense gratification is not good. One is, considered to be a failure in life as long as he makes no inquiry about the, nature of work for fruitive results, for as long as one is engrossed in the, consciousness of sense gratification, one has to transmigrate from one body to, another. Although the mind may be engrossed in fruitive activities and, influenced by ignorance, one must develop a love for devotional service to, Väsudeva. Only then can one have the opportunity to get out of the bondage, of material existence. (Bhäg. 5.5.4-6), Therefore, jïäna (or knowledge that one is not this material body but spirit, soul) is not sufficient for liberation. One has to act in the status of spirit soul,, otherwise there is no escape from material bondage. Action in Kåñëa, consciousness is not, however, action on the fruitive platform. Activities, performed in full knowledge strengthen one’s advancement in real knowledge., Without Kåñëa consciousness, mere renunciation of fruitive activities does not, actually purify the heart of a conditioned soul. As long as the heart is not, purified, one has to work on the fruitive platform. But action in Kåñëa, consciousness automatically helps one escape the result of fruitive action so, that one need not descend to the material platform. Therefore, action in, Kåñëa consciousness is always superior to renunciation, which always entails a, risk of falling. Renunciation without Kåñëa consciousness is incomplete, as is, confirmed by Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé in his Bhak ti-rasämåta-sindbu., präpaïcikatayä buddhyä hari-sambandhi-vastunaù, mumukñubhiù parityägo vairägyaà phalgu kathyate., Renunciation by persons eager to achieve liberation of things which are, related to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, though they are material, is, called incomplete renunciation. Renunciation is compete when it is in the, knowledge that everything in existence belongs to the Lord and that no one, should claim proprietorship over anything. One should understand that,, factually, nothing belongs to anyone. Then where is the question of, renunciation? One who knows that everything is Kåñëa’s property is always, situated in renunciation. Since everything belongs to Kåñëa, everything should, be employed in the service of Kåñëa. This perfect form of action in Kåñëa, consciousness is far better than any amount of artificial renunciation by a, sannyäsé of the Mäyävädé school."

Such a renouncer,, dedicated to the transcendental loving service of the Lord, is fully qualified in, knowledge because he knows his constitutional position in his relationship, with Kåñëa. He knows fully well that Kåñëa is the whole and that he is part, and parcel of Kåñëa. Such knowledge is perfect because it is qualitatively and, quantitatively correct. The concept of oneness with Kåñëa is incorrect because, the part cannot be equal to the whole. Knowledge that one is one in quality, yet different in quantity is correct transcendental knowledge leading one to, become full in himself, having nothing to aspire to nor lament over. There is, no duality in his mind because whatever he does, he does for Kåñëa. Being thus, freed from the platform of dualities, he is liberated—even in this material, world."

Since the ultimate goal of life is self-realization, there is no difference, between the conclusions reached by the two processes. By säìkhya, philosophical research one comes to the conclusion that a living entity is not a, part and parcel of the material world, but of the supreme spirit whole., Consequently, the spirit soul has nothing to do with the material world; his, actions must be in some relation with the Supreme. When he acts in Kåñëa, consciousness, he is actually in his constitutional position. In the first process, of säìkhya, one has to become detached from matter, and in the devotional, yoga process one has to attach himself to the work of Kåñëa. Factually, both, processes are the same, although superficially one process appears to involve, detachment and the other process appears to involve attachment. However,, detachment from matter and attachment to Kåñëa are one and the same. One, who can see this sees things as they are."

The, Mäyävädé sannyäsés also study the Vedänta-sütras, but use their own, commentary, called Çäréraka-bhäñya, written by Çaìkaräcärya. The students of, the Bhägavata school are engaged in devotional service of the Lord, according, to päïcarätriké regulations, and therefore the Vaiñëava sannyäsés have multiple, engagements in the transcendental service of the Lord. The Vaiñëava, sannyäsés have nothing to do with material activities, and yet they perform, various activities in their devotional service to the Lord. But the Mäyävädé, sannyäsés, engaged in the studies of säìkhya and Vedänta and speculation,, cannot relish transcendental service of the Lord. Because their studies become, very tedious, they sometimes become tired of Brahman speculation, and thus, they take shelter of the Bhägavatam without proper understanding., Consequently their study of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam becomes troublesome., Dry speculations and impersonal interpretations by artificial means are all, useless for the Mäyävädé sannyäsés. The Vaiñëava sannyäsés, who are engaged, in devotional service, are happy in the discharge of their transcendental, duties, and they have the guarantee of ultimate entrance into the kingdom of, God. The Mäyävädé sannyäsés sometimes fall down from the path of self-, realization and again enter into material activities of a philanthropic and, altruistic nature, which are nothing but material engagements. Therefore, the, conclusion is that those who are engaged in Kåñëa consciousness are better, situated than the sannyäsés engaged in simple Brahman speculation, although, they too come to Kåñëa consciousness, after many births."

          "One who is on the path of liberation by Kåñëa consciousness is very dear to, every living being, and every living being is dear to him. This is due to his, Kåñëa consciousness. Such a person cannot think of any living being as, separate from Kåñëa, just as the leaves and branches of a tree are not separate, from the tree. He knows very well that by pouring water on the root of the, tree, the water will be distributed to all the leaves and branches, or by, supplying food to the stomach, the energy is automatically distributed, throughout the body. Because one who works in Kåñëa consciousness is, servant to all, he is very dear to everyone. And, because everyone is satisfied, by his work, he is pure in consciousness. Because he is pure in consciousness,, his mind is completely controlled. And, because his mind is controlled, his, senses are also controlled. Because his mind is always fixed on Kåñëa, there is, no chance of his being deviated from Kåñëa. Nor is there a chance that he will, engage his senses in matters other than the service of the Lord. He does not, like to hear anything except topics relating to Kåñëa; he does not like to eat, anything which is not offered to Kåñëa; and he does not wish to go anywhere if, Kåñëa is not involved. Therefore, his senses are controlled. A man of, controlled senses cannot be offensive to anyone. One may ask, Why then was, Arjuna offensive (in battle) to others? Wasn't he in Kåñëa consciousness?, Arjuna was only superficially offensive because (as has already been explained, in the Second Chapter) all the assembled persons on the battlefield would, continue to live individually, as the soul cannot be slain. So, spiritually, no one, was killed on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra. Only their dresses were changed by, the order of Kåñëa, who was personally present. Therefore Arjuna, while, fighting on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra, was not really fighting at all; he was, simply carrying out the orders of Kåñëa in full Kåñëa consciousness.

Because while speaking,, evacuating, receiving, opening or closing his eyes, he always knows that only, the material senses are engaged with their objects and that he is aloof from, them., PURPORT, A person in Kåñëa consciousness is pure in his existence, and consequently, he has nothing to do with any work which depends upon five immediate and, remote causes: the doer, the work, the situation, the endeavor and fortune., This is because he is engaged in the loving transcendental service of Kåñëa., Although he appears to be acting with his body and senses, he is always, conscious of his actual position, which is spiritual engagement. In material, consciousness, the senses are engaged in sense gratification, but in Kåñëa, consciousness the senses are engaged in the satisfaction of Kåñëa’s senses., Therefore, the Kåñëa conscious person is always free, even though he appears, to be engaged in things of the senses. Activities such as seeing, hearing,, speaking, evacuating, etc., are actions of the senses meant for work. A Kåñëa, consciousness person is never affected by the actions of the senses. He cannot, perform any act except in the service of the Lord because he knows that he is, the eternal servitor of the Lord."

          "Here brahmaëi means in Kåñëa consciousness. The material world is a sum, total manifestation of the three modes of material nature, technically called, the pradhäna. The Vedic hymns, sarvam etad brahma, tasmäd etad brahma, näma-rüpam annaà ca jäyate, and, in the Bhagavad-gétä, mama yonir mahad, brahma, indicate that everything in the material world is the manifestation of, Brahman; and, although the effects are differently manifested, they are, nondifferent from the cause. In the Éçopaniñad it is said that everything is, related to the Supreme Brahman or Kåñëa, and thus everything belongs to, Him only. One who knows perfectly well that everything belongs to Kåñëa,, that He is the proprietor of everything and that, therefore, everything is, engaged in the service of the Lord, naturally has nothing to do with the results, of his activities, whether virtuous or sinful. Even one’s material body, being a, gift of the Lord for carrying out a particular type of action, can be engaged in, Kåñëa consciousness. It is beyond contamination by sinful reactions, exactly as, the lotus leaf, though remaining in the water, is not wet. The Lord also says in, the Gétä: mayi sarväëi karmäëi sannyasya: Resign all works unto Me [Kåñëa]., The conclusion is that a person without Kåñëa consciousness acts according to, the concept of the material body and senses, but a person in Kåñëa, consciousness acts according to the knowledge that the body is the property of, Kåñëa and should therefore be engaged in the service of Kåñëa."

Kåñëa is the, Supreme Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead. In Kåñëa consciousness,, there is no duality. All that exists is a product of Kåñëa’s energy, and Kåñëa is, all good.

Therefore, when one takes to Kåñëa, consciousness, one at once becomes completely aloof from bodily activities. In, such a controlled life, in which his deliberations are changed, he lives happily, within the city of nine gates. The nine gates are described as follows:, nava-dväre pure dehé haàso leläyate bahiù, vaçé sarvasya lokasya sthävarasya carasya ca., The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is living within the body of a, living entity, is the controller of all living entities all over the universe.

He is simply in the midst of the material ocean,, struggling for existence. The waves of the ocean are tossing him, and he has no, control over them.

          "The Sanskrit word vibhuù means the Supreme Lord who is full of unlimited, knowledge, riches, strength, fame, beauty and renunciation. He is always, satisfied in Himself, undisturbed by sinful or pious activities. He does not, create a particular situation for any living entity, but the living entity,, bewildered by ignorance, desires to be put into certain conditions of life, and, thereby his chain of action and reaction begins. A living entity is, by superior, nature, full of knowledge. Nevertheless, he is prone to be influenced by, ignorance due to his limited power. The Lord is omnipotent, but the living, entity is not. The Lord is vibhu, or omniscient, but the living entity is aëu, or, atomic. Because he is a living soul, he has the capacity to desire by his free will., Such desire is fulfilled only by the omnipotent Lord. And so, when the living, entity is bewildered in his desires, the Lord allows him to fulfill those desires,, but the Lord is never responsible for the actions and reactions of the particular, situation which may be desired. Being in a bewildered condition, therefore,, the embodied soul identifies himself with the circumstantial material body and, becomes subjected to the temporary misery and happiness of life. The Lord is, the constant companion of the living entity as Paramätmä, or the Supersoul,, and therefore He can understand the desires of the individual soul, as one can, smell the flavor of a flower by being near it. Desire is a subtle form of, conditioning of the living entity. The Lord fulfills his desire as he deserves:, Man proposes and God disposes. The individual is not, therefore, omnipotent, in fulfilling his desires. The Lord, however, can fulfill all desires, and the Lord,, being neutral to everyone, does not interfere with the desires of the minute, independant living entities. However, when one desires Kåñëa, the Lord takes, special care and encourages one to desire in such a way that one can attain to, Him and be eternally happy. The Vedic hymn therefore declares:, eña u hy eva sädhu karma kärayati taà yamebhyo lokebhya unninéñate, eña u eväsädhu karma kärayati yamadho ninéñate., ajïo jantur anéso ’yam ätmanaù sukha-duùkhayoù, éçvara-prerito gacchet svargaà väçvabhram eva ca., The Lord engages the living entity in pious activities so he may be, elevated. The Lord engages him in impious activities so he may go to hell. The, living entity is completely dependant in his distress and happiness. By the will, of the Supreme he can go to heaven or hell, as a cloud is driven by the air., Therefore the embodied soul, by his immemorial desire to avoid Kåñëa, consciousness, causes his own bewilderment. Consequently, although he is, constitutionally eternal, blissful and cognizant, due to the littleness of his, existence he forgets his constitutional position of service to the Lord and is, thus entrapped by nescience. And, under the spell of ignorance, the living, entity claims that the Lord is responsible for his conditional existence. The, Vedänta-sütras also confirm this:, vaiñamya-nairghåëye na säpekñatvät tathä hi darçayati., The Lord neither hates nor likes anyone, though He appears to."

It is stated in the, Bhagavad-gétä, sarvaà jïäna-plavena, jïänägniù sarva-karmäëi and na hi, jïänena sadåçam. Knowledge is always highly esteemed. And what is that, knowledge? Perfect knowledge is achieved when one surrenders unto Kåñëa, as, is said in the Seventh Chapter, 19th verse: bahünäà janmanäm ante jïänavän, mäà prapadyate. After passing through many, many births, when one perfect, in knowledge surrenders unto Kåñëa, or when one attains Kåñëa consciousness,, then everything is revealed to him, as the sun reveals everything in the, daytime. The living entity is bewildered in so many ways. For instance, when, he thinks himself God, unceremoniously, he actually falls into the last snare of, nescience. If a living entity is God, then how can he become bewildered by, nescience? Does God become bewildered by nescience? If so, then nescience,, or Satan, is greater than God. Real knowledge can be obtained from a person, who is in perfect Kåñëa consciousness. Therefore, one has to seek out such a, bona fide spiritual master and, under him, learn what Kåñëa consciousness is., The spiritual master can drive away all nescience, as the sun drives away, darkness. Even though a person may be in full knowledge that he is not this, body but is transcendental to the body, he still may not be able to discriminate, between the soul and the Supersoul. However, he can know everything well if, he cares to take shelter of the perfect, bona fide Kåñëa conscious spiritual, master. One can know God and one’s relationship with God only when one, actually meets a representative of God. A representative of God never claims, that he is God, although he is paid all the respect ordinarily paid to God, because he has knowledge of God. One has to learn the distinction between, God and the living entity. Lord Çré Kåñëa therefore stated in the Second, Chapter (2.12) that every living being is individual and that the Lord also is, individual. They were all individuals in the past, they are individuals at, present, and they will continue to be individuals in the future, even after, liberation. At night we see everything as one in the darkness, but in day when, the sun is up, we see everything in its real identity. Identity with individuality, in spiritual life is real knowledge."

This is due to their relationship to, the Supreme, for the Supreme Lord, by His plenary portion as Paramätmä, is, present in everyone’s heart. Such an understanding of the Supreme is real, knowledge. As far as the bodies are concerned in different castes or different, species of life, the Lord is equally kind to everyone because He treats every, living being as a friend yet maintains Himself as Paramätmä regardless of the, circumstances of the living entities. The Lord as Paramätmä is present both in, the outcaste and in the brähmaëa, although the body of a brähmaëa and that, of an outcaste are not the same. The bodies are material productions of, different modes of material nature, but the soul and the Supersoul within the, body are of the same spiritual quality. The similarity in the quality of the soul, and the Supersoul, however, does not make them equal in quantity, for the, individual soul is present only in that particular body, whereas the Paramätmä, is present in each and every body. A Kåñëa conscious person has full, knowledge of this, and therefore he is truly learned and has equal vision. The, similar characteristics of the soul and Supersoul are that they are both, conscious, eternal and blissful. But the difference is that the individual soul is, conscious within the limited jurisdiction of the body, whereas the Supersoul is, conscious of all bodies. The Supersoul is present in all bodies without, distinction."

This knowledge elevates him to the station of knowing, the complete science of the Absolute Truth, namely Brahman, Paramätmä and, Bhagavän.

The Bhägavatam, confirms this fact as follows:, yat-päda-paìkaja-paläça-viläsa-bhaktyä, karmäçayaà grathitam udgrathayanti santaù, tadvan na rikta-matayo yatayo ’pi ruddha-, srotogaëäs tam araëaà bhaja väsudevam., Just try to worship, in devotional service, Väsudeva, the Supreme, Personality of Godhead. Even great sages are not able to control the forces of, the senses as effectively as those who are engaged in transcendental bliss by, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, uprooting the deep grown desire for fruitive, activities. (Bhäg. 4.22.39), In the conditioned soul the desire to enjoy the fruitive results of work is so, deep-rooted that it is very difficult even for the great sages to control such, desires, despite great endeavors. A devotee of the Lord, constantly engaged in, devotional service in Kåñëa consciousness, perfect in self-realization, very, quickly attains liberation in the Supreme. Owing to his complete knowledge in, self-realization, he always remains in trance.

Similarly do I also, O Padmaja!, The fish brings up its offspring simply by looking at them. The tortoise, brings up its offspring simply by meditation. The eggs of the tortoise are laid, on land, and the tortoise meditates on the eggs while in the water. Similarly, a, devotee in Kåñëa consciousness, although far away from the Lord’s abode, can, elevate himself to that abode simply by thinking of Him constantly—by, engagement in Kåñëa consciousness.

When he is well situated in devotional service,, one comes to the transcendental position, qualified to feel the presence of the, Lord in the sphere of one’s activity. This particular position is called liberation, in the Supreme., After explaining the above principles of liberation in the Supreme, the Lord, gives instruction to Arjuna as to how one can come to that position by the, practice of mysticism or yoga, known as añöäìga-yoga, which is divisible into an, eightfold procedure called yama, niyama, äsana, präëäyäma, pratyähära,, dhäraëä, dhyäna, and samädhi. In the Sixth Chapter the subject of yoga is, explicitly detailed, and at the end of the Fifth it is only preliminarily, explained. One has to drive out the sense objects such as sound, touch, form,, taste and smell by the pratyähära (breathing) process in yoga, and then keep, the vision of the eyes between the two eyebrows and concentrate on the tip of, the nose with half closed lids. There is no benefit in closing the eyes, altogether, because then there is every chance of falling asleep. Nor is there, benefit in opening the eyes completely, because then there is the hazard of, being attracted by sense objects. The breathing movement is restrained within, the nostrils by neutralizing the up- and down-moving air within the body. By, practice of such yoga one is able to gain control over the senses, refrain from, outward sense objects, and thus prepare oneself for liberation in the Supreme., This yoga process helps one become free from all kinds of fear and anger and, thus feel the presence of the Supersoul in the transcendental situation. In, other words, Kåñëa consciousness is the easiest process of executing yoga, principles. This will be thoroughly explained in the next chapter. A Kåñëa, conscious person, however, being always engaged in devotional service, does, not risk losing his senses to some other engagement. This is a better way of, controlling the senses than by the añöäìga-yoga."

          "The conditioned souls within the clutches of illusory energy are all anxious, to attain peace in the material world. But they do not know the formula for, peace, which is explained in this part of the Bhagavad-gétä. The greatest peace, formula is simply this: Lord Kåñëa is the beneficiary in all human activities., Men should offer everything to the transcendental service of the Lord because, He is the proprietor of all planets and the demigods thereon. No one is greater, than He. He is greater than the greatest of the demigods, Lord Çiva and Lord, Brahmä. In the Vedas the Supreme Lord is described as tam éçvaräëäà, paramaà maheçvaram. Under the spell of illusion, living entities are trying to, be lords of all they survey, but actually they are dominated by the material, energy of the Lord. The Lord is the master of material nature, and the, conditioned souls are under the stringent rules of material nature. Unless one, understands these bare facts, it is not possible to achieve peace in the world, either individually or collectively. This is the sense of Kssna consciousness:, Lord Kåñëa is the supreme predominator, and all living entities, including the, great demigods, are His subordinates. One can attain perfect peace only in, complete Kåñëa consciousness., This Fifth Chapter is a practical explanation of Kåñëa consciousness, generally, known as karma-yoga. The question of mental speculation as to how karma-, yoga can give liberation is answered herewith. To work in Kåñëa consciousness, is to work with the complete knowledge of the Lord as the predominator. Such, work is not different from transcendental knowledge. Direct Kåñëa, consciousness is bhakti-yoga, and jïäna-yoga is a path leading to bhakti-yoga., Kåñëa consciousness means to work in full knowledge of one’s relationship, with the Supreme Absolute, and the perfection of this consciousness is full, knowledge of Kåñëa, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A pure soul is, the eternal servant of God as His fragmental part and parcel. He comes into, contact with mäyä (illusion) due to the desire to lord it over mäyä, and that is, the cause of his many sufferings. As long as he is in contact with matter, he, has to execute work in terms of material necessities. Kåñëa consciousness,, however, brings one into spiritual life even while one is within the jurisdiction, of matter, for it is an arousing of spiritual existence by practice in the material, world. The more one is advanced, the more he is freed from the clutches of, matter. The Lord is not partial toward anyone. Everything depends on one’s, practical performance of duties in an effort to control the senses and conquer, the influence of desire and anger. And, attaining Kåñëa consciousness by, controlling the above-mentioned passions, one remains factually in the, transcendental stage, or brahman-nirväëa. The eightfold yoga mysticism is, automatically practiced in Kåñëa consciousness because the ultimate purpose is, served. There is gradual process of elevation in the practice of yama, niyama,, äsana, pratyähära, dhyäna, dhäraëä, präëäyäma, and samädhi. But these only, preface perfection by devotional service, which alone can award peace to the, human being. It is the highest perfection of life., Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Fifth Chapter of the Çrémad-, Bhagavad-gétä in the matter of Karma-yoga, or Action in Kåñëa Consciousness.]"
