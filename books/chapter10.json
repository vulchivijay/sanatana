          "The word paramam is explained thus by Paräçara Muni: one who is full in, six opulences, who has full strength, full fame, wealth, knowledge, beauty and, renunciation, is paramam, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. While, Kåñëa was present on this earth, He displayed all six opulences. Therefore, great sages like Paräçara Muni have all accepted Kåñëa as the Supreme, Personality of Godhead. Now Kåñëa is instructing Arjuna in more confidential, knowledge of His opulences and His work. Previously, beginning with the, Seventh Chapter, the Lord already explained His different energies and how, they are acting. Now in this chapter He explains His specific opulences to, Arjuna. In the previous chapter he has clearly explained His different energies, to establish devotion in firm conviction. Again in this chapter He tells Arjuna, about His manifestations and various opulences., The more one hears about the Supreme God, the more one becomes fixed in, devotional service. One should always hear about the Lord in the association, of devotees; that will enhance one’s devotional service. Discourses in the, society of devotees can take place only among those who are really anxious to, be in Kåñëa consciousness. Others cannot take part in such discourses. The, Lord clearly tells Arjuna that because he is very dear to Him, for his benefit, such discourses are taking place."

          "As stated in the Brahma-saàhitä, Lord Kåñëa is the Supreme Lord. No one, is greater than Him; He is the cause of all causes. Here it is also stated by the, Lord personally that He is the cause of all the demigods and sages. Even the, demigods and great sages cannot understand Kåñëa; they can understand, neither His name nor His personality, so what is the position of the so-called, scholars of this tiny planet? No one can understand why this Supreme God, comes to earth as an ordinary human being and executes such commonplace, and yet wonderful activities. One should know, then, that scholarship is not, the qualification necessary to understand Kåñëa. Even the demigods and the, great sages have tried to understand Kåñëa by their mental speculation, and, they have failed to do so. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam also it is clearly said that, even the great demigods are not able to understand the Supreme Personality, of Godhead. They can speculate to the limits of their imperfect senses and can, reach the opposite conclusion of impersonalism, of something not manifested, by the three qualities of material nature, or they can imagine something by, mental speculation, but it is not possible to understand Kåñëa by such foolish, speculation., Here the Lord indirectly says that if anyone wants to know the Absolute, Truth, “Here I am present as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. I am the, Supreme.” One should know this. Although one cannot understand the, inconceivable Lord who is personally present, He nonetheless exists. We can, actually understand Kåñëa, who is eternal, full of bliss and knowledge, simply, by studying His words in Bhagavad-gétä and Çrémad-Bhägavatam. The, impersonal Brahman can be conceived by persons who are already in the, inferior energy of the Lord, but the Personality of Godhead cannot be, conceived unless one is in the transcendental position., Because most men cannot understand Kåñëa in His actual situation, out of His, causeless mercy He descends to show favor to such speculators. Yet despite the, Supreme Lord’s uncommon activities, these speculators, due to contamination, in the material energy, still think that the impersonal Brahman is the, Supreme. Only the devotees who are fully surrendered unto the Supreme Lord, can understand, by the grace of the Supreme Personality, that He is Kåñëa., The devotees of the Lord do not bother about the impersonal Brahman, conception of God; their faith and devotion bring them to surrender, immediately unto the Supreme Lord, and out of the causeless mercy of Kåñëa,, they can understand Kåñëa. No one else can understand Him. So even great, sages agree: What is ätmä, what is the Supreme? It is He whom we have to, worship."

          "As stated in the Seventh Chapter, those who are trying to elevate, themselves to the platform of spiritual realization are not ordinary men. They, are superior to millions and millions of ordinary men who have no knowledge, of spiritual realization, but out of those actually trying to understand their, spiritual situation, one who can come to the understanding that Kåñëa is the, Supreme Personality of Godhead, the proprietor of everything, the unborn, is, the most successful spiritually realized person. In that stage only, when one has, fully understood Kåñëa’s supreme position, can one be free completely from all, sinful reactions., Here the word ajam, meaning unborn, should not be confused with the living, entities, who are described in the Second Chapter as ajam. The Lord is, different from the living entities who are taking birth and dying due to, material attachment. The conditional souls are changing their bodies, but His, body is not changeable. Even when He comes to this material world, He comes, as the same unborn; therefore in the Fourth Chapter it is said that the Lord,, by His internal potency, is not under the inferior material energy, but is always, in the superior energy., He was existing before the creation, and He is different from His creation. All, the demigods were created within this material world, but as far as Kåñëa is, concerned, it is said that He is not created; therefore Kåñëa is different even, from the great demigods like Brahmä and Çiva. And because He is the creator, of Brahmä, Çiva and all the other demigods, He is the Supreme Person of all, planets., Çré Kåñëa is therefore different from everything that is created, and anyone, who knows Him as such immediately becomes liberated from all sinful, reaction. One must be liberated from all sinful activities to be in the, knowledge of the Supreme Lord. Only by devotional service can He be known, and not by any other means, as stated in Bhagavad-gétä., One should not try to understand Kåñëa as a human being. As stated, previously, only a foolish person thinks Him to be a human being. This is again, expressed here in a different way. A man who is not foolish, who is intelligent, enough to understand the constitutional position of the Godhead, is always, free from all sinful reactions., If Kåñëa is known as the son of Devaké, then how can He be unborn? That is, also explained in Çrémad-Bhägavatam: When He appeared before Devaké and, Vasudeva, He was not born as an ordinary child; He appeared in His original, form, and then He transformed Himself into an ordinary child., Anything done under the direction of Kåñëa is transcendental. It cannot be, contaminated by the material reactions, which may be auspicious or, inauspicious. The conception that there are things auspicious and inauspicious, in the material world is more or less a mental concoction because there is, nothing auspicious in the material world. Everything is inauspicious because, the very material mask is inauspicious. We simply imagine it to be auspicious., Real auspiciousness depends on activities in Kåñëa consciousness in full, devotion and service. Therefore if we at all want our activities to he, auspicious, then we should work under the directions of the Supreme Lord., Such directions are given in authoritative scriptures such as Çrémad-, Bhägavatam and Bhagavad-gétä, or from a bona fide spiritual master. Because, the spiritual master is the representative of the Supreme Lord, his direction is, directly the direction of the Supreme Lord. The spiritual master, saintly, persons and scriptures direct in the same way. There is no contradiction in, these three sources. All actions done under such direction are free from the, reactions of pious or impious activities of this material world. The, transcendental attitude of the devotee in the performance of activities is, actually that of renunciation, and this is called sannyäsa. Anyone acting under, the direction of the Supreme Lord is actually a sannyäsé and a yogé, and not the, man who has simply taken the dress of the sannyäsé, or a pseudo-yogé., TEXTS 4–5, buiÖjaRNaMaSaMMaaeh +aMaa SaTYa& dMa XaMa ), Sau%& du%& >avae_>aavae >aYa& ca>aYaMaev c )) 4 )), Aih&Saa SaMaTaa TauiíSTaPaae daNa& YaXaae_YaXa ), >aviNTa >aava >aUTaaNaa& Mata Wv Pa*QaiGvDaa )) 5 )), buddhir jïänam asammohaù, kñamä satyaà damaù çamaù, sukhaà duùkhaà bhavo ’bhävo, bhayaà cäbhayam eva ca, ahiàsä samatä tuñöis, tapo dänaà yaço ’yaçaù, bhavanti bhävä bhütänäà, matta eva påthag-vidhäù, buddhiù—intelligence; jïänam—knowledge; asam-mohaù—freedom from, doubt; kñamä—forgiveness; satyam—truthfulness; damaù—control of the, senses; çamaù—control of the mind; sukham—happiness; duùkham—distress;, bhavaù—birth; abhävaù—death; bhayam—fear; ca—also; abhayam—without, fear; eva—also; ca—and; ahiàsä—nonviolence; samatä—equilibrium; tuñöiù, —satisfaction; tapaù—penance; dänam—charity; yaçaù—fame; ayaçaù—, infamy; bhavanti—become; bhäväù—natures; bhütänäm—of living entities;, mattaù—from Me; eva—certainly; påthak-vidhäù—differently arranged., TRANSLATION, Intelligence, knowledge, freedom from doubt and delusion, forgiveness,, truthfulness, self-control and calmness, pleasure and pain, birth, death, fear,, fearlessness, nonviolence, equanimity, satisfaction, austerity, charity, fame and, infamy are created by Me alone., PURPORT, The different qualities of living entities, be they good or bad, are all created, by Kåñëa, and they are described here., Intelligence refers to the power of analyzing things in proper perspective, and, knowledge refers to understanding what is spirit and what is matter. Ordinary, knowledge obtained by a university education pertains only to matter, and it is, not accepted here as knowledge. Knowledge means knowing the distinction, between spirit and matter. In modern education there is no knowledge about, the spirit; they are simply taking care of the material elements and bodily, needs. Therefore academic knowledge is not complete., Asaàmohaù, freedom from doubt and delusion, can be achieved when one is, not hesitant and when he understands the transcendental philosophy. Slowly, but surely he becomes free from bewilderment. Nothing should be accepted, blindly; everything should be accepted with care and with caution. Kñamä,, forgiveness, should be practiced, and one should excuse the minor offenses of, others. Satyam, truthfulness, means that facts should be presented as they are, for the benefit of others. Facts should not be misrepresented. According to, social conventions, it is said that one can speak the truth only when it is, palatable to others. But that is not truthfulness. The truth should be spoken in, a straight and forward way, so that others will understand actually what the, facts are. If a man is a thief and if people are warned that he is a thief, that is, truth. Although sometimes the truth is unpalatable, one should not refrain, from speaking it. Truthfulness demands that the facts be presented as they are, for the benefit of others. That is the definition of truth., Self-control means that the senses should not be used for unnecessary personal, enjoyment. There is no prohibition against meeting the proper needs of the, senses, but unnecessary sense enjoyment is detrimental for spiritual, advancement. Therefore the senses should be restrained from unnecessary use., Similarly, the mind should not indulge in unnecessary thoughts; that is called, çamaù, or calmness. Nor should one spend one’s time pondering over earning, money. That is a misuse of the thinking power. The mind should be used to, understand the prime necessity of human beings, and that should be presented, authoritatively. The power of thought should be developed in association with, persons who are authorities in the scriptures, saintly persons and spiritual, masters and those whose thinking is highly developed. Sukham, pleasure or, happiness, should always be in that which is favorable for the cultivation of, the spiritual knowledge of Kåñëa consciousness. And similarly, that which is, painful or which causes distress is that which is unfavorable for the cultivation, of Kåñëa consciousness. Anything favorable for the development of Kåñëa, consciousness should be accepted, and anything unfavorable should be, rejected., Bhava, birth, should be understood to refer to the body. As far as the soul is, concerned, there is neither birth nor death; that we have discussed in the, beginning of Bhagavad-gétä. Birth and death apply to one’s embodiment in the, material world. Fear is due to worrying about the future. A person in Kåñëa, consciousness has no fear because by his activities he is sure to go back to the, spiritual sky, back home, back to Godhead. Therefore his future is very bright., Others, however, do not know what their future holds; they have no, knowledge of what the next life holds. So they are therefore in constant, anxiety. If we want to get free from anxiety, then the best course is to, understand Kåñëa and be situated always in Kåñëa consciousness. In that way, we will be free from all fear. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam. it is stated that fear is, caused by our absorption in the illusory energy, but those who are free from, the illusory energy, those who are confident that they are not the material, body, that they are spiritual parts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and, are therefore engaged in the transcendental service of the Supreme Godhead,, have nothing to fear. Their future is very bright. This fear is a condition of, persons who are not in Kåñëa consciousness. Bhayam, fearlessness, is only, possible for one in Kåñëa consciousness., Ahiàsä, nonviolence, means that one should not do anything which will put, others into misery or confusion. Material activities that are promised by so, many politicians, sociologists, philanthropists, etc., do not produce very good, results because the politicians and philanthropists have no transcendental, vision; they do not know what is actually beneficial for human society. Ahiàsä, means that people should be trained in such a way that the full utilization of, the human body can be achieved. The human body is meant for spiritual, realization, so any movement or any commissions which do not further that, end commit violence on the human body. That which furthers the future, spiritual happiness of the people in general is called nonviolence., Samatä, equanimity, refers to freedom from attachment and aversion. To be, very much attached or to be very much detached is not the best. This material, world should be accepted without attachment or aversion. Similarly, that, which is favorable for prosecuting Kåñëa consciousness should be accepted;, that which is unfavorable should be rejected. That is called samatä,, equanimity. A person in Kåñëa consciousness has nothing to reject and, nothing to accept unless it is useful in the prosecution of Kåñëa consciousness., Tuñöiù, satisfaction, means that one should not be eager to gather more and, more material goods by unnecessary activity. One should be satisfied with, whatever is obtained by the grace of the Supreme Lord; that is called, satisfaction. Tapas means austerity or penance. There are many rules and, definitions in the Vedas which apply here, like rising early in the morning and, taking a bath. Sometimes it is very troublesome to rise early in the morning,, but whatever voluntary trouble one may suffer in this way is called penance., Similarly, there are prescriptions for fasting on certain days of the month. One, may not be inclined to practice such fasting, but because of his determination, to make advancement in the science of Kåñëa consciousness, he should accept, such bodily troubles which are recommended. However, one should not fast, unnecessarily or against Vedic injunctions. One should not fast for some, political purpose; that is described in Bhagavad-gétä as fasting in ignorance,, and anything done in ignorance or passion does not lead to spiritual, advancement. Everything done in the mode of goodness does advance one,, however, and fasting done in terms of the Vedic injunctions enriches one in, spiritual knowledge., As far as charity is concerned, one should give fifty percent of his earnings to, some good cause. And what is a good cause? It is that which is conducted in, terms of Kåñëa consciousness. That is not only a good cause, but it is the best, cause. Because Kåñëa is good, His cause is also good. Thus charity should be, given to a person who is engaged in Kåñëa consciousness. According to Vedic, literature, it is enjoined that charity should be given to the brähmaëas. This, practice is still followed, although not very nicely in terms of the Vedic, injunction. But still the injunction is that charity should be given to the, brähmaëas. Why? Because they are engaged in higher cultivation of spiritual, knowledge. A brähmaëa is supposed to devote his whole life to understanding, Brahman. A brahma-jana is one who knows Brahman; he is called a brähmaëa., Thus charity is offered to the brähmaëas because since they are always, engaged in higher spiritual service, they have no time to earn their livelihood., In the Vedic literature, charity is also to be awarded to the renouncer of life,, the sannyäsé. The sannyäsés beg from door to door, not for money but for, missionary purposes. The system is that they go from door to door to awaken, the householders from the slumber of ignorance. Because the householders are, engaged in family affairs and have forgotten their actual purpose in, life―awakening their Kåñëa consciousness―it is the business of the sannyäsés, to go as beggars to the householders and encourage them to be Kåñëa, conscious. As it is said in the Vedas, one should awake and achieve what is due, him in this human form of life. This knowledge and method is distributed by, the sannyäsés; hence charity is to be given to the renouncer of life, to the, brähmaëas, and similar good causes, not to any whimsical cause., Yaçaù, fame, should be according to Lord Caitanya, who said that a man is, famous when he is known as a great devotee. That is real fame. If one has, become a great man in Kåñëa consciousness and it is known, then he is truly, famous. One who does not have such fame is infamous., All these qualities are manifest throughout the universe in human society and, in the society of the demigods. There are many forms of humanity on other, planets, and these qualities are there. Now, for one who wants to advance in, Kåñëa consciousness, Kåñëa creates all these qualities, but the person develops, them himself from within. One who engages in the devotional service of the, Supreme Lord develops all the good qualities, as arranged by the Supreme, Lord., Of whatever we find, good or bad, the origin is Kåñëa. Nothing can manifest in, this material world which is not in Kåñëa. That is knowledge; although we, know that things are differently situated, we should realize that everything, flows from Kåñëa."

          "The highest summit of spiritual perfection is knowledge of the Supreme, Personality of Godhead. Unless one is firmly convinced of the different, opulences of the Supreme Lord, he cannot engage in devotional service., Generally people know that God is great, but they do not know in detail how, God is great. Here are the details. If one knows factually how God is great,, then naturally he becomes a surrendered soul and engages himself in the, devotional service of the Lord. When one factually knows the opulences of the, Supreme, there is no alternative but to surrender to Him. This factual, knowledge can be known from the descriptions in Çrémad-Bhägavatam and, Bhagavad-gétä and similar literatures., In the administration of this universe there are many demigods distributed, throughout the planetary system, and the chief of them are Brahmä, Lord Çiva, and the four great Kumäras and other patriarchs. There are many forefathers, of the population of the universe, and all of them are born of the Supreme, Lord Kåñëa. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, is the original, forefather of all forefathers., These are some of the opulences of the Supreme Lord. When one is firmly, convinced of them, he accepts Kåñëa with great faith and without any doubt,, and he engages in devotional service. All this particular knowledge is required, in order to increase one’s interest in the loving devotional service of the Lord., One should not neglect to understand fully how great Kåñëa is, for by knowing, the greatness of Kåñëa one will be able to be fixed in sincere devotional, service."

          "A learned scholar who has studied the Vedas perfectly and has information, from authorities like Lord Caitanya and who knows how to apply these, teachings can understand that Kåñëa is the origin of everything in both the, material and spiritual worlds, and because he knows this perfectly he becomes, firmly fixed in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord. He can never be, deviated by any amount of nonsensical commentaries or by fools. All Vedic, literature agrees that Kåñëa is the source of Brahmä, Çiva and all other, demigods. In the Atharva-veda it is said, “yo brahmäëaà vidadhäti: pürvaà yo, vai vedäàç ca gäpayati sma kåñëaù.” “It was Kåñëa who in the beginning, instructed Brahmä in Vedic knowledge and who disseminated Vedic, knowledge in the past.” Then again it is said, “atha puruño ha vai näräyaëo, ’kämayata prajäù såjeya ity upakramya.” “Then the Supreme Personality, Näräyaëa desired to create living entities.” Again it is said:, näräyaëäd brahmä jäyate, näräyaëäd prajäpatiù prajäyate, näräyaëäd indro, jäyate, näräyaëäd añöau vasavo jäyante, näräyaëäd ekädaça rudrä jäyante,, näräyaëäd dvädaçädityäù., “From Näräyaëa, Brahmä is born, and from Näräyaëa, the patriarchs are, also born. From Näräyaëa, Indra is born, from Näräyaëa the eight Vasus are, born, from Näräyaëa the eleven Rudras are born, from Näräyaëa the twelve, Ädityas are born.”, It is said in the same Vedas: brahmaëyo devaké-putraù: “The son of Devaké,, Kåñëa, is the Supreme Personality.” Then it is said:, eko vai näräyaëa äsén na brahmä na éçäno näpo nägni samau neme, dyäv-äpåthivé na nakñaträëi na süryaù sa ekäké na ramate tasya, dhyänäntaù sthasya yatra chändogaiù kriyamäëäñöakädi-saàjïakä, stuti-stomaù stomam ucyate., “In the beginning of the creation there was only the Supreme Personality, Näräyaëa. There was no Brahmä, no Çiva, no fire, no moon, no stars in the, sky, no sun. There was only Kåñëa, who creates all and enjoys all.”, In the many Puräëas it is said that Lord Çiva was born from the highest, the, Supreme Lord Kåñëa, and the Vedas say that it is the Supreme Lord, the, creator of Brahmä and Çiva, who is to be worshiped. In the Mokña-dharma, Kåñëa also says, prajäpatià ca rudraà cäpy aham eva såjämi vai tau hi mäà na, vijänéto mama mäyä-vimohitau. “The patriarchs, Çiva and others are created by, Me, though they do not know that they are created by Me because they are, deluded by My illusory energy.” In Varäha Puräëa it is also said, näräyaëaù, paro devas tasmäj jätaç caturmukhaù tasmäd rudro ’bhavad devaù sa ca, sarvajïatäà gataù. “Näräyaëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and, from Him Brahmä was born, from whom Çiva was born.”, Lord Kåñëa is the source of all generations, and He is called the most efficient, cause of everything. He says that because “everything is born of Me, I am the, original source of all. Everything is under Me; no one is above Me.” There is, no supreme controller other than Kåñëa. One who understands Kåñëa in such, a way from a bona fide spiritual master and from Vedic literature, who engages, all his energy in Kåñëa consciousness, becomes a truly learned man. In, comparison to him, all others, who do not know Kåñëa properly, are but fools., Only a fool would consider Kåñëa to be an ordinary man. A Kåñëa conscious, person should not be bewildered by fools; he should avoid all unauthorized, commentaries and interpretations on Bhagavad-gétä and proceed in Kåñëa, consciousness with determination and firmness."

          "Pure devotees, whose characteristics are mentioned here, engage, themselves fully in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Their minds, cannot be diverted from the lotus feet of Kåñëa. Their talks are solely on the, transcendental subjects. The symptoms of the pure devotees are described in, this verse specifically. Devotees of the Supreme Lord are twenty-four hours, daily engaged in glorifying the pastimes of the Supreme Lord. Their hearts and, souls are constantly submerged in Kåñëa, and they take pleasure in discussing, Him with other devotees., In the preliminary stage of devotional service they relish the transcendental, pleasure from the service itself, and in the mature stage they are actually, situated in love of God. Once situated in that transcendental position, they, can relish the highest perfection which is exhibited by the Lord in His abode., Lord Caitanya likens transcendental devotional service to the sowing of a seed, in the heart of the living entity. There are innumerable living entities, traveling throughout the different planets of the universe, and out of them, there are a few who are fortunate enough to meet a pure devotee and get the, chance to understand devotional service. This devotional service is just like a, seed, and if it is sown in the heart of a living entity, and if he goes on hearing, and chanting, Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma,, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare, that seed fructifies, just as the seed of a, tree fructifies with regular watering. The spiritual plant of devotional service, gradually grows and grows until it penetrates the covering of the material, universe and enters into the brahmajyoti effulgence in the spiritual sky. In the, spiritual sky also that plant grows more and more until it reaches the highest, planet, which is called Goloka Våndävana, the supreme planet of Kåñëa., Ultimately, the plant takes shelter under the lotus feet of Kåñëa and rests, there. Gradually, as a plant grows fruits and flowers, that plant of devotional, service also produces fruits, and the watering process in the form of chanting, and hearing goes on. This plant of devotional service is fully described in the, Caitanya-caritämåta. It is explained there that when the complete plant takes, shelter under the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, one becomes fully absorbed, in love of God; then he cannot live even for a moment without being in, contact with the Supreme Lord, just as a fish cannot live without water. In, such a state, the devotee actually attains the transcendental qualities in, contact with the Supreme Lord., The Çrémad-Bhägavatam is also full of such narration about the relationship, between the Supreme Lord and His devotees; therefore the Çrémad-, Bhägavatam is very dear to the devotees. In this narration there is nothing, about material activities, sense gratification or liberation. Çrémad-Bhägavatam, is the only narration in which the transcendental nature of the Supreme Lord, and His devotees is fully described. Thus the realized souls in Kåñëa, consciousness take continual pleasure in hearing such transcendental, literatures, just as a young boy and girl take pleasure in association."

          "In this verse the word buddhi-yogam is very significant. We may remember, that in the Second Chapter the Lord, instructing Arjuna, said that He had, spoken to him of many things and that He would instruct him in the way of, buddhi-yoga. Now buddhi-yoga is explained. Buddhi-yogam itself is action in, Kåñëa consciousness; that is the highest intelligence. Buddhi means, intelligence, and yogam means mystic activities or mystic elevation. When one, tries to go back home, back to Godhead, and takes fully to Kåñëa consciousness, in devotional service, his action is called buddhi-yogam. In other words,, buddhi-yogam is the process by which one gets out of the entanglement of this, material world. The ultimate goal of progress is Kåñëa. People do not know, this; therefore the association of devotees and a bona fide spiritual master are, important. One should know that the goal is Kåñëa, and when the goal is, assigned, then the path is slowly but progressively traversed, and the ultimate, goal is achieved., When a person knows the goal of life but is addicted to the fruits of activities,, he is acting in karma-yoga. When he knows that the goal is Kåñëa, but he takes, pleasure in mental speculations to understand Kåñëa, he is acting in jïäna-, yoga. And when he knows the goal and seeks Kåñëa completely in Kåñëa, consciousness and devotional service, he is acting in bhakti-yoga, or buddhi-, yoga, which is the complete yoga. This complete yoga is the highest, perfectional stage of life., A person may have a bona fide spiritual master and may be attached to a, spiritual organization, but still, if he is not intelligent enough to make progress,, then Kåñëa from within gives him instructions so that he may ultimately come, to Him without difficulty. The qualification is that a person always engage, himself in Kåñëa consciousness and with love and devotion render all kinds of, services. He should perform some sort of work for Kåñëa, and that work should, be with love. If a devotee is intelligent enough, he will make progress on the, path of self-realization. If one is sincere and devoted to the activities of, devotional service, the Lord gives him a chance to make progress and, ultimately attain to Him."

          "When Lord Caitanya was in Benares promulgating the chanting of Hare, Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma, Räma, Hare Hare, thousands of people were following Him. Prakäçänanda, a, very influential and learned scholar in Benares at that time, derided Lord, Caitanya for being a sentimentalist. Sometimes philosophers criticize the, devotees because they think that most of the devotees are in the darkness of, ignorance and are philosophically naive sentimentalists. Actually that is not, the fact. There are very, very learned scholars who have put forward the, philosophy of devotion, but even if a devotee does not take advantage of their, literatures or of his spiritual master, if he is sincere in his devotional service he, is helped by Kåñëa Himself within his heart. So the sincere devotee engaged in, Kåñëa consciousness cannot be without knowledge. The only qualification is, that one carry out devotional service in full Kåñëa consciousness., The modern philosophers think that without discriminating one cannot have, pure knowledge. For them this answer is given by the Supreme Lord: those, who are engaged in pure devotional service, even though they be without, sufficient education and even without sufficient knowledge of the Vedic, principles, are still helped by the Supreme God, as stated in this verse., The Lord tells Arjuna that basically there is no possibility of understanding, the Supreme Truth, the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead,, simply by speculating, for the Supreme Truth is so great that it is not possible, to understand Him or to achieve Him simply by making a mental effort. Man, can go on speculating for several millions of years, and if he is not devoted, if, he is not a lover of the Supreme Truth, he will never understand Kåñëa or the, Supreme Truth. Only by devotional service is the Supreme Truth, Kåñëa,, pleased, and by His inconceivable energy He can reveal Himself to the heart of, the pure devotee. The pure devotee always has Kåñëa within his heart;, therefore he is just like the sun that dissipates the darkness of ignorance. This, is the special mercy rendered to the pure devotee by Kåñëa., Due to the contamination of material association, through many, many, millions of births, one’s heart is always covered with the dust of materialism,, but when one engages in devotional service and constantly chants Hare Kåñëa,, the dust quickly clears, and one is elevated to the platform of pure knowledge., The ultimate goal of Viñëu can be attained only by this chant and by, devotional service, and not by mental speculation or argument. The pure, devotee does not have to worry about the necessities of life; he need not be, anxious because when he removes the darkness from his heart, everything is, provided automatically by the Supreme Lord, for He is pleased by the loving, devotional service of the devotee. This is the essence of the Gétä’s teachings., By studying Bhagavad-gétä, one can become a completely surrendered soul to, the Supreme Lord and engage himself in pure devotional service. As the Lord, takes charge, one becomes completely free from all kinds of materialistic, endeavors., TEXTS 12–13, AJauRNa ovac, Par& b]ø Par& DaaMa Paiv}a& ParMa& >avaNa( ), Pauåz& XaaìTa& idVYaMaaiddevMaJa& iv>auMa( )) 12 )), AahuSTvaMa*zYa SaveR devizRNaaRrdSTaQaa ), AiSaTaae devl/ae VYaaSa SvYa& cEv b]vqiz Mae )) 13 )), arjuna uväca, paraà brahma paraà dhäma, pavitraà paramaà bhavän, puruñaà çäçvataà divyam, ädi-devam ajaà vibhum, ähus tväm åñayaù sarve, devarñir näradas tathä, asito devalo vyäsaù, svayaà caiva bravéñi me, arjunaù uväca—Arjuna said; param—supreme; brahma—truth; param—, supreme; dhäma—sustenance; pavitram—purest; paramam—supreme; bhavän, —Yourself; puruñam—personality; çäçvatam—original; divyam—, transcendental; ädi-devam—original Lord; ajam—unborn; vibhum—greatest;, ähuù—say; tväm—unto You; åñayaù—sages; sarve—all; devarñiù—the sage, among the demigods; näradaù—Närada; tathä—also; asitaù—Asita; devalaù—, Devala; vyäsaù—Vyäsa; svayam—personally; ca—also; eva—certainly; bravéñi, —explaining; me—unto me., TRANSLATION, Arjuna said: You are the Supreme Brahman, the ultimate, the supreme abode, and purifier, the Absolute Truth and the eternal divine person. You are the, primal God, transcendental and original, and You are the unborn and all-, pervading beauty. All the great sages such as Närada, Asita, Devala, and Vyäsa, proclaim this of You, and now You Yourself are declaring it to me., PURPORT, In these two verses the Supreme Lord gives a chance to the modern, philosopher, for here it is clear that the Supreme is different from the, individual soul. Arjuna, after hearing the essential four verses of Bhagavad-gétä, in this chapter, became completely free from all doubts and accepted Kåñëa as, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He at once boldly declares, “You are, Parambrahma, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.” And previously Kåñëa, states that He is the originator of everything and everyone. Every demigod and, every human being is dependant on Him. Men and demigods, out of ignorance,, think that they are absolute and independant of the Supreme Lord Kåñëa., That ignorance is removed perfectly by the discharge of devotional service., This is already explained in the previous verse by the Lord. Now by His grace,, Arjuna is accepting Him as the Supreme Truth, in concordance with the, Vedic injunction. It is not because Kåñëa is an intimate friend of Arjuna that, he is flattering Him by calling Him the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the, Absolute Truth. Whatever Arjuna says in these two verses is confirmed by, Vedic truth. Vedic injunctions affirm that only one who takes to devotional, service to the Supreme Lord can understand Him, whereas others cannot., Each and every word of this verse spoken by Arjuna is confirmed by Vedic, injunction., In the Kena Upaniñad it is stated that the Supreme Brahman is the rest for, everything, and Kåñëa has already explained that everything is resting on Him., The Muëòaka Upaniñad confirms that the Supreme Lord, in whom everything, is resting, can be realized only by those who engage constantly in thinking of, Him. This constant thinking of Kåñëa is smaraëam, one of the methods of, devotional service. It is only by devotional service to Kåñëa that one can, understand his position and get rid of this material body., In the Vedas the Supreme Lord is accepted as the purest of the pure. One who, understands that Kåñëa is the purest of the pure can become purified from all, sinful activities. One cannot be disinfected from sinful activities unless he, surrenders unto the Supreme Lord. Arjuna’s acceptance of Kåñëa as the, supreme pure complies with the injunctions of Vedic literature. This is also, confirmed by great personalities, of whom Närada is the chief., Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and one should always meditate, upon Him and enjoy one’s transcendental relationship with Him. He is the, supreme existence. He is free from bodily needs, birth and death. Not only, does Arjuna confirm this, but all the Vedic literatures. the Puräëas and, histories. In all Vedic literatures Kåñëa is thus described, and the Supreme, Lord Himself also says in the Fourth Chapter, “Although I am unborn, I, appear on this earth to establish religious principles.” He is the supreme origin;, He has no cause, for He is the cause of all causes, and everything is emanating, from Him. This perfect knowledge can be had by the grace of the Supreme, Lord., Here Arjuna expresses himself through the grace of Kåñëa. If we want to, understand Bhagavad-gétä, we should accept the statements in these two, verses. This is called the paramparä system, acceptance of the disciplic, succession. Unless one is in the disciplic succession, he cannot understand, Bhagavad-gétä. It is not possible by so-called academic education., Unfortunately those proud of their academic education, despite so much, evidence in Vedic literatures, stick to their obstinate conviction that Kåñëa is, an ordinary person."

By the grace of the, Supreme Lord, Arjuna has understood that the Supreme Truth is Kåñëa and, that He is the perfect one. One should therefore follow the path of Arjuna. He, received the authority of Bhagavad-gétä. As described in the Fourth Chapter,, the paramparä system of disciplic succession for the understanding of, Bhagavad-gétä was lost, and therefore Kåñëa reestablished that disciplic, succession with Arjuna because He considered Arjuna His intimate friend and, a great devotee. Therefore, as stated in our Introduction to Gétopaniñad,, Bhagavad-gétä should be understood in the paramparä system. When the, paramparä system was lost, Arjuna was again selected to rejuvenate it. The, acceptance of Arjuna of all that Kåñëa says should be emulated; then we can, understand the essence of Bhagavad-gétä, and then only can we understand, that Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

          "The Supreme Lord Kåñëa can be known by persons who are in a, relationship with Him through the discharge of devotional service, like Arjuna, and his successors. Persons of demonic or atheistic mentality cannot know, Kåñëa. Mental speculation that leads one away from the Supreme Lord is a, serious sin, and one who does not know Kåñëa should not try to comment on, Bhagavad-gétä. Bhagavad-gétä is the statement of Kåñëa, and since it is the, science of Kåñëa, it should be understood from Kåñëa as Arjuna understood it., It should not be received from atheistic persons., The Supreme Truth is realized in three aspects: as impersonal Brahman,, localized Paramätmä and at last as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So at, the last stage of understanding the Absolute Truth, one comes to the Supreme, Personality of Godhead. A liberated man and even a common man may realize, impersonal Brahman or localized Paramätmä, yet they may not understand, God’s personality from the verses of Bhagavad-gétä, which are being spoken by, this person, Kåñëa. Sometimes the impersonalists accept Kåñëa as Bhagavan, or, they accept His authority. Yet many liberated persons cannot understand, Kåñëa as Puruñottama, the Supreme Person, the father of all living entities., Therefore Arjuna addresses Him as Puruñottama. And if one comes to know, Him as the father of all the living entities, still one may not know Him as the, supreme controller; therefore He is addressed here as Bhüteça, the supreme, controller of everyone. And even if one knows Kåñëa as the supreme, controller of all living entities, still one may not know that He is the origin of, all the demigods; therefore He is addressed herein as Devadeva, the worshipful, God of all demigods. And even if one knows Him as the worshipful God of all, demigods, one may not know that He is the supreme proprietor of everything;, therefore He is addressed as Jagatpati. Thus the truth about Kåñëa is, established in this verse by the realization of Arjuna, and we should follow in, the footsteps of Arjuna to understand Kåñëa as He is."

Now Arjuna is convinced that His friend, Kåñëa, is the Supreme, Godhead, but he wants to know the general process by which the all-pervading, Lord can be understood by the common man. No common man, including the, demons and atheists, can know Kåñëa because He is guarded by His yoga-mäyä, energy. Again, these questions are asked by Arjuna for their benefit. The, superior devotee is not only concerned for his own understanding, but for the, understanding of all mankind. Out of his mercy, because he is a Vaiñëava, a, devotee, Arjuna is opening the understanding for the common man as far as, the all-pervasiveness of the Supreme is concerned. He addresses Kåñëa, specifically as yogin because Çré Kåñëa is the master of the yoga-mäyä energy by, which He is covered and uncovered to the common man. The common man, who has no love for Kåñëa cannot always think of Kåñëa; therefore he has to, think materially. Arjuna is considering the mode of thinking of the, materialistic persons of this world. Because materialists cannot understand, Kåñëa spiritually, they are advised to concentrate the mind on physical things, and try to see how Kåñëa is manifested by physical representations."

Those who, have entered into a transcendental relationship with Kåñëa relish in every step, descriptions of the pastimes of the Lord.” Thus Arjuna is interested to hear, about Kåñëa, specifically how He remains as the all-pervading Supreme Lord., Now as far as amåtam, nectar, is concerned, any narration or statement, concerning Kåñëa is just like nectar. And this nectar can be perceived by, practical experience. Modern stories, fiction and histories are different from, the transcendental pastimes of the Lord in that one will tire of hearing, mundane stories, but one never tires of hearing about Kåñëa. It is for this, reason only that the history of the whole universe is replete with references to, the pastimes of the incarnations of Godhead. For instance, the Puräëas are, histories of bygone ages that relate the pastimes of the various incarnations of, the Lord. In this way the reading matter remains forever fresh, despite, repeated readings."

Rather, the very topics of, Kåñëa are so relishable that they appear to them as nectar. Thus they enjoy, them. In discussing Kåñëa’s opulences and His diverse energies, the pure, devotees take transcendental pleasure. Therefore they want to hear and, discuss them. Kåñëa knows that living entities do not understand the extent of, His opulences; He therefore agrees to state only the principal manifestations, of His different energies. The word prädhänyataù (principal) is very important, because we can understand only a few of the principal details of the Supreme, Lord, for His features are unlimited. It is not possible to understand them all., And vibhüti, as used in this verse, refers to the opulences by which He controls, the whole manifestation. In the Amara-koça dictionary it is stated that vibhüti, indicates an exceptional opulence., The impersonalist or the pantheist cannot understand the exceptional, opulences of the Supreme Lord nor the manifestations of His divine energy., Both in the material world and in the spiritual world His energies are, distributed in every variety of manifestation. Now Kåñëa is describing what, can be directly perceived by the common man; thus part of His variegated, energy is described in this way."

For those who are sleeping in the darkness of, ignorance, it is not possible to understand how the Supreme Godhead, manifests Himself in the material and spiritual worlds. Thus this address by, Kåñëa to Arjuna is significant. Because Arjuna is above such darkness, the, Personality of Godhead agrees to describe His various opulences., Kåñëa first informs Arjuna that He is the Self or soul of the entire cosmic, manifestation by dint of His primary expansion. Before the material creation,, the Supreme Lord, by His plenary expansion, accepts the Puruña incarnations,, and from Him everything begins. Therefore He is ätmä, the soul of the mahat-, tattva, the universal elements. The total material energy is not the cause of the, creation, but actually the Mahä-Visëu enters into the mahat-tattva, the total, material energy. He is the soul. When Mahä-Viñëu enters into the manifested, universes, He again manifests Himself as the Supersoul in each and every, entity. We have experience that the personal body of the living entity exists, due to the presence of the spiritual spark. Without the existence of the, spiritual spark, the body cannot develop. Similarly, the material manifestation, cannot develop unless the Supreme Soul of Kåñëa enters., The Supreme Personality of Godhead is existing as the Supersoul in all, manifested universes. A description of the three puruña-avatäras is given in, Çrémad-Bhägavatam. “The Supreme Personality of Godhead manifests three, features, as Käraëodakaçäyé Visëu, Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu and Kñérodakaçäyé, Viñëu, in this material manifestation.” The Supreme Lord Kåñëa, the cause of, all causes, lies down in the cosmic ocean as Mahä-Viñëu or Käraëodakaçäyé, Viñëu, and therefore Kåñëa is the beginning of this universe, the maintainer of, the universal manifestation, and the end of all the energy."

Amongst the regulated, poetry, the Gäyatré mantra, which is chanted by the duly qualified brähmaëas,, is the most prominent. The Gäyatré mantra is mentioned in the Çrémad-, Bhägavatam. Because the Gäyatré mantra is especially meant for God, realization, it represents the Supreme Lord. This mantra is meant for, spiritually advanced people, and when one attains success in chanting it, he, can enter into the transcendental position of the Lord. One must first acquire, the qualities of the perfectly situated person, the qualities of goodness, according to the laws of material nature, in order to chant the Gäyatré mantra., The Gäyatré mantra is very important in Vedic civilization and is considered, to be the sound incarnation of Brahman. Brahmä is its initiator, and it is, passed down from him in disciplic succession., The months of November and December are considered the best of all months, because in India grains are collected from the fields at this time, and the, people become very happy. Of course spring is a season universally liked, because it is neither too hot nor too cold, and the flowers and trees blossom, and flourish. In spring there are also many ceremonies commemorating Kåñëa’s, pastimes; therefore this is considered to be the most joyful of all seasons, and it, is the representative of the Supreme Lord Kåñëa."

          "The Supreme Lord is represented throughout the entire material universes, by His entering into all things as the Supersoul. The Lord here tells Arjuna, that there is no point in understanding how things exist in their separate, opulence and grandeur. He should know that all things are existing due to, Kåñëa’s entering them as Supersoul. From Brahmä, the most gigantic entity, on, down to the smallest ant, all are existing because the Lord has entered each, and all and is sustaining them., Worship of demigods is discouraged herein because even the greatest demigods, like Brahmä and Çiva only represent part of the opulence of the Supreme, Lord. He is the origin of everyone born, and no one is greater than Him. He is, samatä, which means that no one is superior to Him and that no one is equal, to Him. In the Viñëu-mantra it is said that one who considers the Supreme, Lord Kåñëa in the same category with demigods―be they even Brahmä or, Çiva―becomes at once an atheist. If, however, one thoroughly studies the, different descriptions of the opulences and expansions of Kåñëa’s energy, then, one can understand without any doubt the position of Lord Çré Kåñëa and can, fix his mind in the worship of Kåñëa without deviation. The Lord is all-, pervading by the expansion of His partial representation, the Supersoul, who, enters into everything that is. Pure devotees, therefore, concentrate their, minds in Kåñëa consciousness in full devotional service; therefore they are, always situated in the transcendental position. Devotional service and worship, of Kåñëa are very clearly indicated in this chapter in verses eight to eleven., That is the way of pure devotional service. How one can attain the highest, devotional perfection of association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has been thoroughly explained in this chapter., Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Tenth Chapter of the Çrémad-, Bhagavad-gétä in the matter of the Opulence of the Absolute.]"
