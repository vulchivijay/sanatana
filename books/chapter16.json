          "In this verse, the royal road to hell is described. The demoniac want to, make a show of religion and advancement in spiritual science, although they, do not follow the principles. They are always arrogant or proud in possessing, some type of education or so much wealth. They desire to be worshiped by, others, and demand respectability, although they do not command respect., Over trifles they become very angry and speak harshly, not gently. They do, not know what should be done and what should not be done. They do, everything whimsically, according to their own desire, and they do not, recognize any authority. These demoniac qualities are taken on by them from, the beginning of their bodies in the wombs of their mothers, and as they grow, they manifest all these inauspicious qualities."

          "Lord Kåñëa encouraged Arjuna by telling him that he was not born with, demoniac qualities. His involvement in the fight was not demoniac because he, was considering the pro’s and con’s. He was considering whether respectable, persons such as Bhéñma and Droëa should be killed or not, so he was not acting, under the influence of anger, false prestige, or harshness. Therefore he was not, of the quality of the demons. For a kñatriya, a military man, shooting arrows at, the enemy is considered transcendental, and refraining from such a duty is, demoniac. Therefore, there was no cause for Arjuna to lament. Anyone who, performs the regulated principles of the different orders of life is, transcendentally situated."

          "Lord Kåñëa, having assured Arjuna that he was born with the divine, qualities, is now describing the demoniac way. The conditioned living entities, are divided into two classes in this world. Those who are born with divine, qualities follow a regulated life; that is to say they abide by the injunctions in, scriptures and by the authorities. One should perform duties in the light of, authoritative scripture. This mentality is called divine. One who does not, follow the regulative principles as they are laid down in the scriptures and who, acts according to his whims is called demoniac or asuric. There is no other, criterion but obedience to the regulative principles of scriptures. It is, mentioned in Vedic literature that both the demigods and the demons are, born of the Prajäpati; the only difference is that one class obeys the Vedic, injunctions and the other does not."

          "In every civilized human society there is some set of scriptural rules and, regulations which are followed from the beginning, especially among the, Äryans, those who adopt the Vedic civilization and who are known as the, most advanced civilized peoples. Those who do not follow the scriptural, injunctions are supposed to be demons. Therefore it is stated here that the, demons do not know the scriptural rules, nor do they have any inclination to, follow them. Most of them do not know them, and even if some of them know,, they have not the tendency to follow them. They have no faith, nor are they, willing to act in terms of the Vedic injunctions. The demons are not clean,, either externally or internally., One should always be careful to keep his body clean by bathing, brushing, teeth, changing clothes, etc. As far as internal cleanliness is concerned, one, should always remember the holy names of God and chant Hare Kåñëa, Hare, Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare, Hare. The demons neither like nor follow all these rules for external and, internal cleanliness., As for behavior, there are many rules and regulations guiding human behavior,, such as the Manu-saàhitä, which is the law of the human race. Even up to, today, those who are Hindu follow the Manu-saàhitä. Laws of inheritance and, other legalities are derived from this book. Now, in the Manu-saàhitä, it is, clearly stated that a woman should not be given freedom. That does not mean, that women are to be kept as slaves, but they are like children. Children are, not given freedom, but that does not mean that they are kept as slaves. The, demons have now neglected such injunctions, and they think that women, should be given as much freedom as men. However, this has not improved the, social condition of the world. Actually, a woman should be given protection at, every stage of life. She should be given protection by the father in her younger, days, by the husband in her youth, and by the grownup sons in her old age., This is proper social behavior according to the Manu-saàhitä. But modern, education has artificially devised a puffed up concept of womanly life, and, therefore marriage is practically now an imagination in human society. Nor is, the moral condition of woman very good now. The demons, therefore, do not, accept any instruction which is good for society, and because they do not, follow the experience of great sages and the rules and regulations laid down by, the sages, the social condition of the demoniac people is very miserable."

For them there, is no difference between spirit and matter, and they do not accept the, Supreme Spirit. Everything is matter only, and the whole cosmos is supposed, to be a mass of ignorance. According to them, everything is void, and, whatever manifestation exists is due to our ignorance in perception. They take, it for granted that all manifestation of diversity is a display of ignorance. Just, as in a dream we may create so many things, which actually have no existence,, so when we are awake we shall see that everything is simply a dream. But, factually, although the demons say that life is a dream, they are very expert in, enjoying this dream. And so, instead of acquiring knowledge, they become, more and more implicated in their dreamland. They conclude that as a child is, simply the result of sexual intercourse between man and woman, this world is, born without any soul. For them it is only a combination of matter that has, produced the living entities, and there is no question of the existence of the, soul. As many living creatures come out from perspiration and from a dead, body without any cause, similarly, the whole living world has come out of the, material combinations of the cosmic manifestation. Therefore material nature, is the cause of this manifestation, and there is no other cause. They do not, believe in the words of Kåñëa in Bhagavad-gétä: mayädhyakñeëa prakåtiù süyate, sa-caräcaram. “Under My direction the whole material world is moving.” In, other words, amongst the demons there is no perfect knowledge of the, creation of this world; every one of them has some particular theory of his, own. According to them, one interpretation of the scriptures is as good as, another, for they do not believe in a standard understanding of the scriptural, injunctions."

They have no idea how to, behave toward one another. Animal killing is very prominent amongst, demoniac people. Such people are considered the enemies of the world because, ultimately they will invent or create something which will bring destruction to, all. Indirectly, this verse anticipates the invention of nuclear weapons, of, which the whole world is today very proud. At any moment war may take, place, and these atomic weapons may create havoc. Such things are created, solely for the destruction of the world, and this is indicated here. Due to, godlessness, such weapons are invented in human society; they are not meant, for the peace and prosperity of the world."

Although they are always full of anxieties on account of, accepting nonpermanent things, they still continue to engage in such, activities out of illusion. They have no knowledge and cannot tell that they, are heading the wrong way. Accepting nonpermanent things, such demoniac, people create their own God, create their own hymns and chant accordingly., The result is that they become more and more attracted to two things—sex, enjoyment and accumulation of material wealth. The word açuci-vratäù,, unclean vow, is very significant in this connection. Such demoniac people are, only attracted by wine, women, gambling and meat eating; those are their, açuci, unclean habits. Induced by pride and false prestige, they create some, principles of religion which are not approved by the Vedic injunctions., Although such demoniac people are most abominable in the world, still, by, artificial means, the world creates a false honor for them.

Thus there is no end to their anxiety. Being, bound by hundreds and thousands of desires, by lust and anger, they secure, money by illegal means for sense gratification., PURPORT, The demoniac accept that the enjoyment of the senses is the ultimate goal, of life, and this concept they maintain until death. They do not believe in life, after death, and they do not believe that one takes on different types of bodies, according to one’s karma, or activities in this world. Their plans for life are, never finished, and they go on preparing plan after plan, all of which are, never finished. We have personal experience of a person of such demoniac, mentality, who, even at the point of death, was requesting the physician to, prolong his life for four years more because his plans were not yet complete., Such foolish people do not know that a physician cannot prolong life even for, a moment. When the notice is there, there is no consideration of the man’s, desire. The laws of nature do not allow a second beyond what one is destined, to enjoy., The demoniac person, who has no faith in God or the Supersoul within, himself, performs all kinds of sinful activities simply for sense gratification. He, does not know that there is a witness sitting within his heart. The Supersoul is, observing the activities of the individual soul. As it is stated in the Vedic, literature, the Upaniñads, there are two birds sitting in one tree; the one is, acting and enjoying or suffering the fruits of the branches, and the other is, witnessing. But one who is demoniac has no knowledge of Vedic scripture, nor, has he any faith; therefore he feels free to do anything for sense enjoyment,, regardless of the consequences., TEXTS 13–15, wdMaÛ MaYaa l/BDaiMaMa& Pa[aPSYae MaNaaerQaMa( ), wdMaSTaqdMaiPa Mae >aivZYaiTa PauNaDaRNaMa( )) 13 )), ASaaE MaYaa hTa Xa}auhRiNaZYae caParaNaiPa ), wRìrae_hMah& >aaeGaq iSaÖae_h& bl/vaNSau%q )) 14 )), Aa!yae_i>aJaNavaNaiSMa k-ae_NYaae_iSTa Sad*Xaae MaYaa ), Ya+Yae daSYaaiMa MaaeidZYa wTYajaNaivMaaeihTaa )) 15 )), idam adya mayä labdham, imaà präpsye manoratham, idam astédam api me, bhaviñyati punar dhanam, asau mayä hataù çatrur, haniñye cäparän api, éçvaro ’ham ahaà bhogé, siddho ’haà balavän sukhé, äòhyo ’bhijanavän asmi, ko ’nyo ’sti sadåço mayä, yakñye däsyämi modiñya, ity ajïäna-vimohitäù, idam—this; adya—today; mayä—by me; labdham—gained; imam—this;, präpsye—I shall gain; manoratham—according to my desires; idam—this; asti, —there is; idam—this; api—also; me—mine; bhaviñyati—will increase in the, future; punaù—again; dhanam—wealth; asau—that; mayä—by me; hataù—, has been killed; çatruù—enemy; haniñye—I shall kill; ca—also; aparän—, others; api—certainly; éçvaraù—the lord; aham—I am; aham—I am; bhogé—, the enjoyer; siddhah—perfect; aham—I am; balavän—powerful; sukhé—, happy; äòhyaù—wealthy; abhijanavän—surrounded by aristocratic relatives;, asmi—I am; kaù—who else; anyaù—other; asti—there is; sadåçaù—like; mayä, —me; yakñye—I shall sacrifice; däsyämi—I shall give in charity; modiñye—I, shall rejoice; iti—thus; ajïäna—ignorance; vimohitäù—deluded by., TRANSLATION, The demoniac person thinks: “So much wealth do I have today, and I will gain, more according to my schemes.

          "The demoniac man knows no limit to his desire to acquire money. That is, unlimited. He only thinks how much assessment he has just now and schemes, to engage that stock of wealth farther and farther. For that reason, he does not, hesitate to act in any sinful way and so deals in the black market for illegal, gratification. He is enamoured by the possessions he has already, such as land,, family, house and bank balance, and he is always planning to improve them., He believes in his own strength, and he does not know that whatever he is, gaining is due to his past good deeds. He is given an opportunity to accumulate, such things, but he has no conception of past causes. He simply thinks that all, his mass of wealth is due to his own endeavor. A demoniac person believes in, the strength of his personal work, not in the law of karma. According to the, law of karma, a man takes his birth in a high family, or becomes rich, or very, well educated, or very beautiful because of good work in the past. The, demoniac thinks that all these things are accidental and due to the strength of, his personal ability. He does not sense any arrangement behind all the, varieties of people, beauty, and education. Anyone who comes into, competition with such a demoniac man is his enemy. There are many, demoniac people, and each is enemy to the others. This enmity becomes more, and more deep—between persons, then between families, then between, societies, and at last between nations. Therefore there is constant strife, war, and enmity all over the world., Each demoniac person thinks that he can live at the sacrifice of all others., Generally, a demoniac person thinks of himself as the Supreme God, and a, demoniac preacher tells his followers: “Why are you seeking God elsewhere?, You are all yourselves God! Whatever you like, you can do. Don’t believe in, God. Throw away God. God is dead.” These are the demoniac’s preachings., Although the demoniac person sees others equally rich and influential, or, even more so, he thinks that no one is richer than him and that no one is, more influential than him. As far as promotion to the higher planetary system, is concerned, he does not believe in performing yajïas or sacrifices. Demons, think that they will manufacture their own process of yajïa and prepare some, machine, by which they will be able to reach any higher planet. The best, example of such a demoniac man was Rävaëa. He offered a program to the, people by which he would prepare a staircase so that anyone could reach the, heavenly planets without performing sacrifices, such as are prescribed in the, Vedas. Similarly, in the present age such demoniac men are striving to reach, the higher planetary systems by mechanical arrangement. These are examples, of bewilderment. The result is that, without their knowledge, they are gliding, toward hell. Here the Sanskrit word mohajäla is very significant. Jäla means, net; like fishes caught in a net, they have no way to come out."

It is clearly stated that such, demons have practically no chance of receiving the mercy of God at any stage, of later life. In the Vedas also it is stated that such persons gradually sink to, become dogs and hogs. It may be then argued in this connection that God, should not be advertised as all-merciful if He is not merciful to such demons., In answer to this question, in the Vedänta-sütra we find that the Supreme, Lord has no hatred for anyone. The placing of the asuras, the demons, in the, lowest status of life is simply another feature of His mercy. Sometimes the, asuras are killed by the Supreme Lord, but this killing is also good for them, for, in Vedic literature we find that anyone who is killed by the Supreme Lord, becomes liberated. There are instances in history of many asuras—Rävaëa,, Kaàsa, Hiraëyakaçipu—to whom the Lord appeared in various incarnations, just to kill. Therefore God’s mercy is shown to the asuras if they are fortunate, enough to be killed by Him."

          "As stated in the Fifteenth Chapter, all the rules and regulations of the, Vedas are meant for knowing Kåñëa. If one understands Krsëa from the, Bhagavad-gétä and becomes situated in Krsëa consciousness, engaging himself, in devotional service, he has reached the highest perfection of knowledge, offered by the Vedic literature. Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu made this process, very easy: He asked people simply to chant Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa, Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare and to, engage in the devotional service of the Lord and eat the remnants of foodstuff, offered to the Deity. One who is directly engaged in all these devotional, activities is to be understood as having studied all Vedic literature. He has, come to the conclusion perfectly. Of course, for the ordinary persons who are, not in Krsëa consciousness or who are not engaged in devotional service, what, is to be done and what is not to be done must be decided by the injunctions of, the Vedas. One should act accordingly, without argument. That is called, following the principles of çästra, or scripture. Çästra is without the four, principal defects that are visible in the conditioned soul: imperfect senses, the, propensity for cheating, certainty of committing mistakes, and certainty of, being illusioned. These four principal defects in conditioned life disqualify one, from putting forth rules and regulations. Therefore, the rules and regulations, as described in the çästra—being above these defects—are accepted without, alteration by all great saints, äcäryas, and great souls., In India there are many parties of spiritual understanding, generally classified, as two: the impersonalist and the personalist. Both of them, however, lead, their lives according to the principles of the Vedas. Without following the, principles of the scriptures, one cannot elevate himself to the perfectional, stage. One who actually, therefore, understands the purport of the çästras is, considered fortunate., In human society, aversion to the principles of understanding the Supreme, Personality of Godhead is the cause of all falldowns. That is the greatest, offense of human life. Therefore, mäyä, the material energy of the Supreme, Personality of Godhead, is always giving us trouble in the shape of the, threefold miseries. This material energy is constituted of the three modes of, material nature. One has to raise himself at least to the mode of goodness, before the path to understanding the Supreme Lord can be opened. Without, raising oneself to the standard of the mode of goodness, one remains in, ignorance and passion, which are the cause of demoniac life. Those in the, modes of passion and ignorance deride the scriptures, deride the holy man, and, deride the proper understanding of the spiritual master, and they do not care, for the regulations of the scriptures. In spite of hearing the glories of, devotional service, they are not attracted. Thus they manufacture their own, way of elevation. These are some of the defects of human society, which lead, to the demoniac status of life. If, however, one is able to be guided by a proper, and bona fide spiritual master, who can lead one to the path of elevation, to, the higher stage, then one’s life becomes successful., Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Sixteenth Chapter of the Çrémad-, Bhagavad-gétä in the matter of the Divine and Demoniac Natures.]"
