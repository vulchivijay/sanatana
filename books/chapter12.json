          "Kåñëa has now explained about the personal, the impersonal and the, universal and has described all kinds of devotees and yogés. Generally, the, transcendentalists can be divided into two classes. One is the impersonalist,, and the other is the personalist. The personalist devotee engages himself with, all energy in the service of the Supreme Lord. The impersonalist engages, himself not directly in the service of Kåñëa but in meditation on the, impersonal Brahman, the unmanifested., We find in this chapter that of the different processes for realization of the, Absolute Truth, bhakti-yoga, devotional service, is the highest. If one at all, desires to have the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then, he must take to devotional service., Those who worship the Supreme Lord directly by devotional service are called, personalists. Those who engage themselves in meditation on the impersonal, Brahman are called impersonalists. Arjuna is here questioning which position, is better. There are different ways to realize the Absolute Truth, but Kåñëa, indicates in this chapter that bhakti-yoga, or devotional service to Him, is, highest of all. It is the most direct, and it is the easiest means for association, with the Godhead., In the Second Chapter the Lord explains that a living entity is not the, material body but is a spiritual spark, a part of the Absolute Truth. In the, Seventh Chapter He speaks of the living entity as part and parcel of the, supreme whole and recommends that he transfer his attention fully to the, whole. In the Eighth Chapter it is stated that whoever thinks of Kåñëa at the, moment of death is at once transferred to the spiritual sky, Kåñëa’s abode. And, at the end of the Sixth Chapter the Lord says that out of all the yogés, he who, thinks of Kåñëa within himself is considered to be the most perfect. So, throughout the Gétä personal devotion to Kåñëa is recommended as the, highest form of spiritual realization. Yet there are those who are still attracted, to Kåñëa’s impersonal brahmajyoti effulgence, which is the all-pervasive aspect, of the Absolute Truth and which is unmanifest and beyond the reach of the, senses. Arjuna would like to know which of these two types of, transcendentalists is more perfect in knowledge. In other words, he is, clarifying his own position because he is attached to the personal form of, Kåñëa. He is not attached to the impersonal Brahman. He wants to know, whether his position is secure. The impersonal manifestation, either in this, material world or in the spiritual world of the Supreme Lord, is a problem for, meditation. Actually, one cannot perfectly conceive of the impersonal feature, of the Absolute Truth. Therefore Arjuna wants to say, “What is the use of, such a waste of time?” Arjuna experienced in the Eleventh Chapter that to be, attached to the personal form of Kåñëa is best because he could thus, understand all other forms at the same time and there was no disturbance to, his love for Kåñëa. This important question asked of Kåñëa by Arjuna will, clarify the distinction between the impersonal and personal conceptions of the, Absolute Truth."

          "In answer to Arjuna’s question, Kåñëa clearly says that he who concentrates, upon His personal form and who worships Him with faith and devotion is to, be considered most perfect in yoga. For one in such Kåñëa consciousness there, are no material activities because everything is done by Kåñëa. A pure devotee, is constantly engaged—sometimes he chants, sometimes he hears or reads, books about Kåñëa, or sometimes he cooks prasädam or goes to the marketplace, to purchase something for Kåñëa, or sometimes he washes the temple or the, dishes—whatever he does, he does not let a single moment pass without, devoting his activities to Kåñëa Such action is in full samädhi., TEXTS 3–4, Yae Tv+arMaiNadeRXYaMaVYa¢&- PaYauRPaaSaTae ), SavR}aGaMaicNTYa& c kU-$=SQaMacl&/ Da]uvMa( )) 3 )), SaiàYaMYaeiNd]YaGa]aMa& SavR}a SaMabuÖYa ), Tae Pa[aPanuviNTa MaaMaev SavR>aUTaihTae rTaa )) 4 )), ye tv akñaram anirdeçyam, avyaktaà paryupäsate, sarvatra-gam acintyaà ca, küöa-stham acalaà dhruvam, sanniyamyendriya-grämaà, sarvatra sama-buddhayaù, te präpnuvanti mäm eva, sarva-bhüta-hite ratäù, ye—those; tu—but; akñaram—which is beyond the perception of the senses;, anirdeçyam—indefinite; avyaktam—unmanifested; paryupäsate—completely, engages; sarvatra-gam—all-pervading; acintyam—inconceivable; ca—also;, küöastham—in the center; acalam—immovable; dhruvam—fixed; sanniyamya, —controlling; indriya-grämam—all the senses; sarvatra—everywhere; sama-, buddayaù—equally disposed; te—they; präpnuvanti—achieve; mäm—unto Me;, eva—certainly; sarva-bhüta-hite—all living entities’ welfare; ratäù—engaged., TRANSLATION, But those who fully worship the unmanifested, that which lies beyond the, perception of the senses, the all-pervading, inconceivable, fixed, and immovable, —the impersonal conception of the Absolute Truth—by controlling the various, senses and being equally disposed to everyone, such persons, engaged in the, welfare of all, at last achieve Me., PURPORT, Those who do not directly worship the Supreme Godhead, Kåñëa, but who, attempt to achieve the same goal by an indirect process, also ultimately, achieve the supreme goal, Çré Kåñëa, as is stated, “After many births the man, of wisdom seeks refuge in Me, knowing Väsudeva is all.” When a person comes, to full knowledge after many births, he surrenders unto Lord Kåñëa. If one, approaches the Godhead by the method mentioned in this verse, he has to, control the senses, render service to everyone and engage in the welfare of all, beings. It is inferred that one has to approach Lord Kåñëa, otherwise there is, no perfect realization. Often there is much penance involved before one fully, surrenders unto Him., In order to perceive the Supersoul within the individual soul, one has to cease, the sensual activities of seeing, hearing, tasting, working, etc. Then one comes, to understand that the Supreme Soul is present everywhere. Realizing this,, one envies no living entity―he sees no difference between man and animal, because he sees soul only, not the outer covering. But for the common man,, this method of impersonal realization is very difficult."

          "The group of transcendentalists who follow the path of the inconceivable,, unmanifested, impersonal feature of the Supreme Lord are called jïäna-yogés,, and persons who are in full Kåñëa consciousness, engaged in devotional service, to the Lord, are called bhakti-yogés. Now, here the difference between jïäna-, yoga and bhakti-yoga is definitely expressed. The process of jïäna-yoga,, although ultimately bringing one to the same goal, is very troublesome,, whereas the path of bhakti-yoga, the process of being in direct service to the, Supreme Personality of Godhead, is easier and is natural for the embodied, soul. The individual soul is embodied since time immemorial. It is very difficult, for him to simply theoretically understand that he is not the body. Therefore,, the bhakti-yogé accepts the Deity of Kåñëa as worshipable because there is some, bodily conception fixed in the mind, which can thus be applied. Of course,, worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His form within the temple, is not idol worship. There is evidence in the Vedic literature that worship may, be saguëa and nirguëa—of the Supreme possessing or not possessing, attributes. Worship of the Deity in the temple is saguëa worship, for the Lord, is represented by material qualities. But the form of the Lord, though, represented by material qualities such as stone, wood, or oil paint, is not, actually material. That is the absolute nature of the Supreme Lord., A crude example may be given here. We may find some mailboxes on the, street, and if we post our letters in those boxes, they will naturally go to their, destination without difficulty. But any old box, or an imitation, which we may, find somewhere, which is not authorized by the post office, will not do the, work. Similarly, God has an authorized representation in the Deity form,, which is called arca-vigraha. This arca-vigraha is an incarnation of the, Supreme Lord. God will accept service through that form. The Lord is, omnipotent and all-powerful; therefore, by His incarnation as arca-vigraha, He, can accept the services of the devotee, just to make it convenient for the man, in conditioned life., So, for a devotee, there is no difficulty in approaching the Supreme, immediately and directly, but for those who are following the impersonal way, to spiritual realization, the path is difficult. They have to understand the, unmanifested representation of the Supreme through such Vedic literatures as, the Upaniñads, and they have to learn the language, understand the, nonperceptual feelings, and they have to realize all these processes. This is not, very easy for a common man. A person in Kåñëa consciousness, engaged in, devotional service, simply by the guidance of the bona fide spiritual master,, simply by offering regulative obeisances unto the Deity, simply by hearing the, glories of the Lord, and simply by eating the remnants of foodstuffs offered to, the Lord, realizes the Supreme Personality of Godhead very easily. There is no, doubt that the impersonalists are unnecessarily taking a troublesome path with, the risk of not realizing the Absolute Truth at the ultimate end. But the, personalist, without any risk, trouble, or difficulty, approaches the Supreme, Personality directly. A similar passage appears in Çrémad-Bhägavatam. It is, stated there that if one has to ultimately surrender unto the Supreme, Personality of Godhead (This surrendering process is called bhakti.), but, instead takes the trouble to understand what is Brahman and what is not, Brahman and spends his whole life in that way, the result is simply, troublesome. Therefore it is advised here that one should not take up this, troublesome path of self-realization because there is uncertainty in the, ultimate result., A living entity is eternally an individual soul, and if he wants to merge into, the spiritual whole, he may accomplish the realization of the eternal and, knowledgeable aspects of his original nature, but the blissful portion is not, realized. By the grace of some devotee, such a transcendentalist, highly learned, in the process of jïäna-yoga, may come to the point of bhakti-yoga, or, devotional service. At that time, long practice in impersonalism also becomes a, source of trouble, because he cannot give up the idea. Therefore an embodied, soul is always in difficulty with the unmanifest, both at the time of practice, and at the time of realization. Every living soul is partially independant, and, one should know for certain that this unmanifested realization is against the, nature of his spiritual blissful self. One should not take up this process. For, every individual living entity the process of Kåñëa consciousness, which entails, full engagement in devotional service, is the best way. If one wants to ignore, this devotional service, there is the danger of turning to atheism. Thus this, process of centering attention on the unmanifested, the inconceivable, which, is beyond the approach of the senses, as already expressed in this verse, should, never be encouraged at any time, especially in this age. It is not advised by, Lord Kåñëa., TEXTS 6–7, Yae Tau SavaRi<a k-MaaRi<a MaiYa SaNNYaSYa MaTPara ), ANaNYaeNaEv YaaeGaeNa Maa& DYaaYaNTa oPaaSaTae )) 6 )), TaezaMah& SaMauÖTaaR Ma*TYauSa&SaarSaaGaraTa( ), >avaiMa Na icraTPaaQaR MaYYaaveiXaTaceTaSaaMa( )) 7 )), ye tu sarväëi karmäëi, mayi sannyasya mat-paräù, ananyenaiva yogena, mäà dhyäyanta upäsate, teñäm ahaà samuddhartä, måtyu-saàsära-sägarät, bhavämi na cirät pärtha, mayy äveçita-cetasäm, ye—one who; tu—but; sarväëi—everything; karmäëi—activities; mayi—unto, Me; sannyasya—giving up; mat-paräù—being attached to Me; ananyena—, without division; eva—certainly; yogena—by practice of such bhakti-yoga;, mäm—unto Me; dhyäyantaù—meditating; upäsate—worship; teñäm—of them;, aham—I; samuddhartä—deliverer; måtyu—that; saàsära—material existence;, sägarät—from the ocean; bhavämi—become; na cirät—not a long time; pärtha, —O son of Påthä; mayi—unto Me; äveçita—fixed; cetasäm—of those whose, minds are like that., TRANSLATION, For one who worships Me, giving up all his activities unto Me and being, devoted to Me without deviation, engaged in devotional service and always, meditating upon Me, who has fixed his mind upon Me, O son of Påthä, for him, I am the swift deliverer from the ocean of birth and death., PURPORT, It is explicitly stated here that the devotees are very fortunate to be, delivered very soon from material existence by the Lord. In pure devotional, service one comes to the realization that God is great and that the individual, soul is subordinate to Him. His duty is to render service to the Lord—if not,, then he will render service to mäyä., As stated before, the Supreme Lord can only be appreciated by devotional, service. Therefore, one should be fully devoted. One should fix his mind fully, on Kåñëa in order to achieve Him. One should work only for Kåñëa. It does not, matter in what kind of work one engages, but that work should be done only, for Kåñëa. That is the standard of devotional service. The devotee does not, desire any achievement other than pleasing the Supreme Personality of, Godhead. His life’s mission is to please Kåñëa, and he can sacrifice everything, for Kåñëa’s satisfaction, just as Arjuna did in the Battle of Kurukñetra. The, process is very simple: one can devote himself in his occupation and engage at, the same time in chanting Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/, Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. Such transcendental, chanting attracts the devotee to the Personality of Godhead., The Supreme Lord herein promises that He will without delay deliver a pure, devotee thus engaged from the ocean of material existence. Those who are, advanced in yoga practice can willfully transfer the soul to whatever planet, they like by the yoga process, and others take the opportunity in various ways,, but as far as the devotee is concerned, it is clearly stated here that the Lord, Himself takes him. He does not need to wait to become very experienced in, order to transfer himself to the spiritual sky., In the Varäha Puräëa this verse appears:, nayämi paramaà sthänam arcirädi-gatià vinä, garuòa-skandham äropya yatheccham aniväritaù, The purport of this verse is that a devotee does not need to practice, añöäìga-yoga in order to transfer his soul to the spiritual planets. The, responsibility is taken by the Supreme Lord Himself. He clearly states here, that He Himself becomes the deliverer. A child is completely cared for by his, parents, and thus his position is secure. Similarly, a devotee does not need to, endeavor to transfer himself by yoga practice to other planets. Rather, the, Supreme Lord, by His great mercy, comes at once, riding on His bird carrier, Garuòa, and at once delivers the devotee from this material existence., Although a man who has fallen in the ocean may struggle very hard and may, be very expert in swimming, he cannot save himself. But if someone comes and, picks him up from the water, then he is easily rescued. Similarly, the Lord, picks up the devotee from this material existence. One simply has to practice, the easy process of Kåñëa consciousness and fully engage himself in devotional, service. Any intelligent man should always prefer the process of devotional, service to all other paths. In the Näräyaëéya this is confirmed as follows:, yä vai sädhana-sampatti-puruñärtha-catuñöaye, tayä vinä tad-äpnoti naro näräyaëäçrayaù, The purport of this verse is that one should not engage in the different, processes of fruitive activity or cultivate knowledge by the mental speculative, process. One who is devoted to the Supreme Personality can attain all the, benefits derived from other yogic processes, speculation, rituals, sacrifices,, charities, etc. That is the specific benediction of devotional service., Simply by chanting the holy name of Kåñëa—Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa,, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare—a, devotee of the Lord can approach the supreme destination easily and happily,, but this destination cannot be approached by any other process of religion., The conclusion of Bhagavad-gétä is stated in the Eighteenth Chapter:, sarva-dharmän parityajya mäm ekaà çaraëaà vraja, ahaà tväà sarva-päpebhyo mokñayiñyämi mä çucaù., One should give up all other processes of self-realization and simply execute, devotional service in Kåñëa consciousness. That will enable one to reach the, highest perfection of life. There is no need for one to consider the sinful, actions of his past life because the Supreme Lord fully takes charge of him., Therefore one should not futilely try to deliver himself in spiritual realization., Let everyone take shelter of the supreme omnipotent Godhead Kåñëa. That is, the highest perfection of life."

When he offers, Kåñëa food, Kåñëa directly accepts these eatables, and the devotee becomes, Kåñëa-ized by eating the remnants.

          "In this verse, two different processes of bhakti-yoga are indicated. The first, applies to one who has actually developed an attachment for Kåñëa, the, Supreme Personality of Godhead, by transcendental love. And the other is for, one who has not developed an attachment for the Supreme Person by, transcendental love. For this second class there are different prescribed rules, and regulations, which one can follow to be ultimately elevated to the stage of, attachment to Kåñëa., Bhakti-yoga is the purification of the senses. At the present moment in, material existence the senses are always impure, being engaged in sense, gratification. But, by the practice of bhakti-yoga these senses can become, purified, and in the purified state they come directly in contact with the, Supreme Lord. In this material existence, I may be engaged in some service to, some master, but I don’t really lovingly serve my master. I simply serve to get, some money. And the master also is not in love; he takes service from me and, pays me. So there is no question of love. But for spiritual life, one must be, elevated to the pure stage of love. That stage of love can be achieved by, practice of devotional service, performed with the present senses., This love of God is now in a dormant state in everyone’s heart. And, there,, love of God is manifested in different ways, but it is contaminated by the, material association. Now the material association has to be purified, and that, dormant, natural love for Kåñëa has to be revived. That is the whole process., To practice the regulative principles of bhakti-yoga one should, under the, guidance of an expert spiritual master, follow certain principles: one should, rise early in the morning, take bath, enter the temple and offer prayers and, chant Hare Kåñëa, then collect flowers to offer to the Deity, cook foodstuffs to, offer to the Deity, take prasädam, and so on. There are various rules and, regulations which one should follow. And one should constantly hear, Bhagavad-gétä and Çrémad-Bhägavatam from pure devotees. This practice can, help anyone to rise to the level of love of God, and then he is sure of his, progress into the spiritual kingdom of God. This practice of bhakti-yoga, under, the rules and regulations, with the direction of a spiritual master, will surely, bring one to the stage of love of God."

          "One who is not able even to practice the regulative principles of bhakti-, yoga, under the guidance of a spiritual master, can still be drawn to this, perfectional stage by working for the Supreme Lord. How to do this work has, already been explained in the fifty-fifth verse of the Eleventh Chapter. One, should be sympathetic to the propagation of Kåñëa consciousness. There are, many devotees who are engaged in the propagation of Kåñëa consciousness,, and they require help. So, even if one cannot directly practice the regulated, principles of bhakti-yoga, he can try to help such work. Every endeavor, requires land, capital, organization, and labor. Just as, in business, one requires, a place to stay, some capital to use, some labor, and some organization to, expand, so the same is required in the service of Kåñëa. The only difference is, that in materialism one works for sense gratification. The same work, however,, can be performed for the satisfaction of Kåñëa, and that is spiritual activity. If, one has sufficient money, he can help in building an office or temple for, propagating Kåñëa consciousness. Or he can help with publications. There are, various fields of activity, and one should be interested in such activities. If one, cannot sacrifice the result of such activities, the same person can still sacrifice, some percentage to propagate Kåñëa consciousness. This voluntary service to, the cause of Kåñëa consciousness will help one to rise to a higher state of love, for God, whereupon one becomes perfect."

          "It may be that one is unable to even sympathize with the activities of Kåñëa, consciousness because of social, familial or religious considerations or because, of some other impediments. If one attaches himself directly to the activities of, Kåñëa consciousness, there may be objection from family members, or so many, other difficulties. For one who has such a problem, it is advised that he, sacrifice the accumulated result of his activities to some good cause. Such, procedures are described in the Vedic rules. There are many descriptions of, sacrifices and special functions of the pumundi or special work in which the, result of one’s previous action may be applied. Thus one may gradually become, elevated to the state of knowledge. It is also found that when one who is not, even interested in the activities of Kåñëa consciousness gives charity to some, hospital or some other social institution, he gives up the hard-earned results of, his activities. That is also recommended here because by the practice of giving, up the fruits of one’s activities one is sure to purify his mind gradually, and in, that purified stage of mind one becomes able to understand Kåñëa, consciousness. Of course Kåñëa consciousness is not dependant on any other, experience because Kåñëa consciousness itself can purify one’s mind, but if, there are impediments to Kåñëa consciousness, one may try to give up the, result of his action. In that respect, social service, community service, national, service, sacrifice for one’s country, etc., may be accepted so that some day one, may come to the stage of pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord. In, Bhagavad-gétä we find it is stated: yataù pravåttir bhütänäm: If one decides to, sacrifice for the supreme cause, even if he does not know that the supreme, cause is Kåñëa, he will come gradually to understand that Kåñëa is the supreme, cause by the sacrificial method."

          "As mentioned in the previous verses, there are two kinds of devotional, service: the way of regulated principles, and the way of full attachment in love, to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For those who are actually not able to, follow the principles of Kåñëa consciousness, it is better to cultivate knowledge, because by knowledge one can be able to understand his real position., Gradually knowledge will develop to the point of meditation. By meditation, one can be able to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by a, gradual process. There are processes which make one understand that one, himself is the Supreme, and that sort of meditation is preferred if one is unable, to engage in devotional service. If one is not able to meditate in such a way,, then there are prescribed duties, as enjoined in the Vedic literature, for the, brähmaëas, vaiçyas, and çüdras, which we shall find in a later chapter of, Bhagavad-gétä. But in all cases, one should give up the result or fruits of labor;, this means to employ the result of karma for some good cause. In summary, to, reach the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the highest goal, there are two, processes: one process is by gradual development, and the other process is, direct. Devotional service in Kåñëa consciousness is the direct method, and the, other method involves renouncing the fruits of one’s activities. Then one can, come to the stage of knowledge, then to the stage of meditation, then to the, stage of understanding the Supersoul, and then to the stage of the Supreme, Personality of Godhead. One may either take the step by step process or the, direct path. The direct process is not possible for everyone; therefore the, indirect process is also good. It is, however, to be understood that the indirect, process is not recommended for Arjuna because he is already at the stage of, loving devotional service to the Supreme Lord. It is for others who are not at, this state; for them the gradual process of renunciation, knowledge, meditation, and realization of the Supersoul and Brahman should be followed. But as far as, Bhagavad-gétä is concerned, it is the direct method that is stressed. Everyone is, advised to take to the direct method and surrender unto the Supreme, Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa., TEXTS 13–14, AÜeía SavR>aUTaaNaa& MaE}a k-å<a Wv c ), iNaMaRMaae iNarhªar SaMadu%Sau% +aMaq )) 13 )), SaNTauí SaTaTa& YaaeGaq YaTaaTMaa d*!iNaêYa ), MaYYaiPaRTaMaNaaebuiÖYaaeR MaÙ¢- Sa Mae iPa[Ya )) 14 )), adveñöä sarva-bhütänäà, maitraù karuëa eva ca, nirmamo nirahaìkäraù, sama-duùkha-sukhaù kñamé, santuñöaù satataà yogé, yatätmä dåòha-niçcayaù, mayy arpita-mano-buddhir, yo mad-bhaktaù sa me priyaù, adveñöä—not envious; sarva-bhütänäm—for all living entities; maitraù—, friendly; karuëaù—kindly; eva—certainly; ca—also; nirmamaù—with no, sense of proprietorship; nirahaìkäraù—without false ego; sama—equally;, duùkhaù—distress; sukhaù—happiness; kñamé—forgiving; santuñöaù—, satisfied; satatam—satisfied; yogé—engaged in devotion; yatä-atmä—, endeavoring; dådùaniçcayaù—with determination; mayi—upon Me; arpita—, engaged; manaù—mind; buddhiù—intelligent; yaù—one who; mat-bhaktaù—, My devotee; saù me priyaù—he is dear to Me., TRANSLATION, One who is not envious but who is a kind friend to all living entities, who does, not think himself a proprietor, who is free from false ego and equal both in, happiness and distress, who is always satisfied and engaged in devotional service, with determination and whose mind and intelligence are in agreement with Me, —he is very dear to Me., PURPORT, Coming again to the point of pure devotional service, the Lord is describing, the transcendental qualifications of a pure devotee in these two verses. A pure, devotee is never disturbed in any circumstances. Nor is he envious of anyone., Nor does a devotee become his enemy’s enemy; he thinks that one is acting as, his enemy due to his own past misdeeds. Thus it is better to suffer than to, protest. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam it is stated: tat te ’nukampäà su-, samékñyamaëo. Whenever a devotee is in distress or has fallen into difficulty,, he thinks that it is the Lord’s mercy upon him. He thinks: “Thanks to my past, misdeeds I should suffer far, far greater than I am suffering now. So it is by the, mercy of the Supreme Lord that I am not getting all the punishment I am due., I am just getting a little, by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of, Godhead.” Therefore he is always calm, quiet and patient, despite many, distressful conditions. A devotee is also always kind to everyone, even to his, enemy. Nirmama means that a devotee does not attach much importance to, the peace and trouble pertaining to the body because he knows perfectly well, that he is not the material body. He does not identify with the body; therefore, he is freed from the conception of false ego and is equiposed both in happiness, and distress. He is tolerant, and he is satisfied with whatever comes by the, grace of the Supreme Lord. He does not endeavor much to achieve something, with great difficulty; therefore he is always joyful. He is a completely perfect, mystic because he is fixed in the instructions received from the spiritual, master, and because his senses are controlled, he is determined. He is not, swayed by false argument because no one can lead him from the fixed, determination of devotional service. He is fully conscious that Kåñëa is the, eternal Lord, so no one can disturb him. All his qualifications enable him to, depend entirely on the Supreme Lord. Such a standard of devotional service is, undoubtably very rare, but a devotee becomes situated in that stage by, following the regulative principles of devotional service. Furthermore, the, Lord says that such a devotee is very dear to Him, for the Lord is always, pleased with all his activities in full Kåñëa consciousness."

At the same time, if others try to put a devotee into, anxiety, he is not disturbed. It is by the grace of the Lord that he is so, practiced that he is not disturbed by any outward disturbance. Actually, because a devotee is always engrossed in Kåñëa consciousness and engaged in, devotional service, all such material circumstances cannot woo him. Generally, a materialistic person becomes very happy when there is something for his, sense gratification and his body, but when he sees that others have something, for their sense gratification and he hasn’t, he is sorry and envious. When he is, expecting some retaliation from an enemy, he is in a state of fear, and when he, cannot successfully execute something he becomes dejected. But a devotee is, always transcendental to all these disturbances; therefore he is very dear to, Kåñëa."

A devotee never takes the part of a particular party; therefore he is, carefree. He is never pained because he is free from all designations; he knows, that his body is a designation, so if there are some bodily pains, he is free. The, pure devotee does not endeavor for anything which is against the principles of, devotional service.

Sometimes one is praised, and sometimes one is defamed; that is the nature of human society. But a, devotee is always transcendental to artificial fame and infamy, distress or, happiness. He is very patient. He does not speak of anything but the topics, about Kåñëa; therefore he is called silent. Silent does not mean that one should, not speak; silent means that one should not speak nonsense. One should speak, only of essentials, and the most essential speech for the devotee is to speak of, the Supreme Lord. He is happy in all conditions; sometimes he may get very, palatable foodstuffs, sometimes not, but he is satisfied. Nor does he care for, any residential facility. He may sometimes live underneath a tree, and he may, sometimes live in a very palatial building; he is attracted to neither. He is, called fixed because he is fixed in his determination and knowledge. We may, find some repetition in the descriptions of the qualifications of a devotee, but, this is just to give an illustration of the fact that a devotee must acquire all, these qualifications. Without good qualifications, one cannot be a pure, devotee. One who is not a devotee has no good qualification. One who wants, to be recognized as a devotee should develop the good qualifications. Of course, he does not extraneously endeavor to acquire these qualifications, but, engagement in Kåñëa consciousness and devotional service automatically helps, him develop them."

          "In this chapter the religion of eternal engagement, the explanation of the, process of transcendental service for approaching the Supreme Lord, is given., This process is very dear to the Lord, and He accepts a person who is engaged, in such a process. The question who is better—one who is engaged in the path, of impersonal Brahman or one who is engaged in the personal service of the, Supreme Personality of Godhead—was raised by Arjuna, and the Lord replied, to him so explicitly that there is no doubt that devotional service to the, Personality of Godhead is the best of all processes of spiritual realization. In, other words, in this chapter it is decided that through good association, one, develops attachment for pure devotional service and thereby accepts a bona, fide spiritual master and from him begins to hear and chant and observe the, regulative principles of devotional service with faith, attachment and devotion, and thus becomes engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord. This path, is recommended in this chapter; therefore there is no doubt that devotional, service is the only absolute path for self-realization, for the attainment of the, Supreme Personality of Godhead. The impersonal conception of the Supreme, Absolute Truth, as described in this chapter, is recommended only up to the, time one surrenders himself for self-realization. In other words, as long as one, does not have the chance to associate with a pure devotee, the impersonal, conception may be beneficial. In the impersonal conception of the Absolute, Truth one works without fruitive result, meditates and cultivates knowledge to, understand spirit and matter. This is necessary as long as one is not in the, association of a pure devotee. Fortunately, if one develops directly a desire to, engage in Kåñëa consciousness in pure devotional service, he does not need to, undergo step by step improvements in spiritual realization. Devotional service,, as described in the middle six chapters of Bhagavad-gétä, is more congenial., One need not bother about materials to keep body and soul together because, by the grace of the Lord everything is carried out automatically., Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Twelfth Chapter of the Çrémad-, Bhagavad-gétä in the matter of Devotional Service.]"
